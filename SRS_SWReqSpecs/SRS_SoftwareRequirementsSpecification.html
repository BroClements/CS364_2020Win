        <p>Uvents is a mobile application that brings the community together by allowing
        </p>
        <div class="indent">
            <ul>
                <li>consumer users to create or participate in events, which can be set as a group event or a date event </li>
                <li>commercial users to list their promotions as an event, which can be seen by the personal users and added to their events </li>
                <li>admin users to manage general event policies, monitor user activity, and maintain the application </li>
            </ul>
            <a name="Purpose"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.1</span>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of Uvents is to provide personal users two-way experience by allowing them to choose to participate in event created by other users and create their own events. </p>
            <p>Additionally, the users can have access on events offered by local business and have the option to add those events to their group events. Uvents will receive revenue by having commercial users paying to have their events listed in the application.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Uvents provides a convenient way for people to easily arrange local events that brings revenue to the local economy and provides recreation in the local area. </p>

            <a name="Scope"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.2</span>Scope</h2>
            <p>Uvents is an application for people to post group events/dates and for people to find and join those group events/dates. Businesses can also pay for a select spot on the application for consumer users to view their events.</p>

            <p>The application will allow consumer users to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>View events posted </li>
                <li>Join an event </li>
                <li>Chat with those in the group event to establish details </li>
                <li>Post a group event </li>
                <li>Post a one on one date with the opposite sex </li>
                <li>Post a group date for 4-6 couples </li>
                <li>Join a date </li>
                <li>The consumer user that posted the event/date would have control of said event </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The application will allow commercial users to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create events that feature their businesses </li>
                <li>Pay for select spots of where their business’ event will appear </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Uvents will help people meet new friends while experiencing an event together. Uvents will also allow those consumer users to post a date or sign up for a date. Businesses will have the ability to promote their events for a price. This feature
                will create revenue from the application. </p>

            <a name="Poverview"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.3</span>Product Overview</h2>
            <p>Uvents is a social app that will provide opportunities to meet new people while doing fun activities. Events will be able to be created by businesses in order to facilitate these opportunities.</p>
            <p>Businesses can create events which can be joined. Funding for the app will come in the form of businesses bidding for priority listings for their sponsored events.</p>
            <div class="indent">
                <a name="#Pperspective"></a>
                <h3><span class="id">1.3.1</span>Product Perspective</h3>
                <p>The primary feature of Uvents is event and group event creation. The creation of group events has similarities to the calendar events feature of Facebook. When consumer users create a group event, they can then invite other consumer users
                    to participate in the event. Consumer users that are invited to a group event can RSVP for the event. A specific type of group event that consumers can make are one-on-one dates or group dates. In this way Uvents has similarities to
                    dating apps like Mutual, however unlike most dating apps, Uvents focuses on helping people to find date ideas, and plan the date itself as opposed to helping users to find people to date. </p>
