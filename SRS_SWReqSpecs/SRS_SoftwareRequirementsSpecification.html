		<a name="Introduction"></a>
		<h1><span class="id">1</span>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Uvents is a mobile application that brings the community together by allowing</p>
		<div class="indent">
			<ul>
				<li>consumer users to create or participate in events, which can be set as a group event or a date event </li>
				<li>commercial users to list their promotions as an event, which can be seen by the personal users and added to their events</li>
				<li>admin users to manage general event policies, monitor user activity, and maintain the application</li>
			</ul>
			<a name="Purpose"></a>
			<h2><span class="id">1.1</span>Purpose</h2>
			<p>The purpose of Uvents is to provide personal users two-way experience by allowing them to choose to participate in events created by other users and create their own events.</p>
			<p>Additionally, consumer users can join and participate in events offered by local businesses. Uvents will receive revenue by having commercial users paying to have their events listed in the application.
			</p>
			<p>Uvents provides a convenient way for people to easily arrange local events, supports the local economy, and provides recreation in the local area.</p>

			<a name="Scope"></a>
			<h2><span class="id">1.2</span>Scope</h2>
			<p>Uvents is an application for people to post group events/dates and for people to find and join those group events/dates. Businesses can also pay for a select spot on the application for consumer users to view their events.</p>
			<p>The application will allow consumer users to: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>View events posted </li>
				<li>Join an event </li>
				<li>Chat with those in the group event to establish details </li>
				<li>Post a group event </li>
				<li>Post a one on one date with the opposite sex </li>
				<li>Post a group date for 4-6 couples </li>
				<li>Join a date </li>
				<li>The consumer user that posted the event/date would have control of said event</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The application will allow commercial users to: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create events that feature their businesses </li>
				<li>Pay for select spots of where their business’ event will appear
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Uvents will help people meet new friends while experiencing an event together. Uvents will also allow those consumer users to post a date or sign up for a date. Businesses will have the ability to promote their events for a price. The event
				promotion feature will create revenue from the application.</p>

			<a name="Poverview"></a>
			<h2><span class="id">1.3</span>Product Overview</h2>
			<p>Uvents will provide opportunities to meet new people while doing fun activities. Events will be able to be created by consumer and commercial users in order to facilitate these opportunities.</p>
			<p>Businesses can create events which can be joined by consumer users. Revenue from the app comes from business sponsored (prioritized or non-prioritized) promotions and business sponsored prioritized events.</p>
			<div class="indent">
				<a name="#Pperspective"></a>
				<h3><span class="id">PO.1</span>Product Perspective</h3>
				<p>The primary feature of Uvents is event and group event creation.</p>
				<p>The creation of group events has similarities to the calendar events feature of Facebook. When consumer users create a group event, they can then invite other consumer users to participate in the event. Consumer users invited to a group
					event can RSVP for the event.</p>
				<p>A specific type of group event consumers can make are one-on-one dates or group dates. Uvents has similarities to dating apps like Mutual. Unlike most dating apps, Uvents focuses on helping people to find date ideas, and plan the date
					itself.
				</p>
				<p>The creation of events comes from commercial users. These users can create an event to promotes their business and post the event on the application. The creation of these events will be like the creation of group events, except the purpose
					will be for advertising and promoting individual businesses. These commercial users will pay for a select spot on the application from which they can post events.</p>
				<div class="indent">

				<h3><span class="id">PO.3</span> User Characteristics</h3>
				<a name="user"></a>
				<p>Uvents will have 3 types of users: consumer, commercial, and admin.</p>
				<div class="indent">
					<h4 class="big"><span class="id">PO.3.1</span> Consumer Users</h4>
					<p>Uvents is a platform where the consumer user receives notifications of the events posted. Consumer users can view events posted by commercial users. Consumer users will have the ability to create group events for themselves and other consumer users to attend. Consumer users will be able to communicate with other consumer users within a group event.</p>
					<h4 class="big"><span class="id">PO.3.2</span>Commercial Users</h4>
					<p>Uvents is a platform where commercial users can advertise the products and services they offer. The commercial user’s goal is to acquire more customers and increase visibility in the local community. Each month, the commercial user will have the ability to post one group event and bid against other commercial users for higher visibility for that group event within Uvents. Group events posted by higher bidding commercial users will be seen more often by consumer users.</p>
					<h4 class="big"><span class="id">PO.3.3</span>Admin Users</h4>
					<p>The admin users’ job is to maintain and moderate Uvents, such that the commercial and consumer users are satisfied with its workings and all issues are resolved quickly and efficiently.</p>
					
					<h4 class="big"><span class="id">PO.3.4</span>Consumer User Workflows</h4>

				<h3><span class="id">PO.4</span> Limitations </h3>
				<a name="Limitations"></a>
				<p>The limitations may present barriers on the functional and non-functional aspects of the application. These limitations outline policies and restrictions that may need to be imposed due to legal, hardware, licensing or other factors.</p>
				<div class="indent">
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.1</span>Legal policies for accepting payments.</h4>
					<p>The “Electronic Fund Transfer Act” or EFT Act of 1978 states that payments must have the validity of an individual’s written signatures in electronic form such as when transferring through automated teller machines, automating clearinghouse
						system, or accepting telephone bill-payment plans. The EFTA Regulation disclosure requires that entities must obtain proper consent under the E-Sign Act. </p>
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.2</span>Legal policies for not selling or trading user information, as defined in Section 5 of the FTC Act. [ER.2]</h4>
					<p>The “Federal Trade Commission Act” or FCT Act prevents unfair methods of competition or deceptive acts or practice in affecting commerce, seeks monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers, gathers or compiles
						information and conduct investigations relating to any involved organization, and makes reports and legislative recommendations to Congress and the public.</p>
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.3</span>Legal policies for users being capable of uploading mature content, as protected in the Communications Decency Act, Section 230 Immunity. [ER.4]</h4>
					<p>The “Communications Decency Act” states that websites or applications may offer platforms for critical and controversial speech or photos without worrying about being sued for wrongful actions on behalf of application users. No user
						or provider of an interactive computer service will be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p>
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.4</span>Compliance with Section 5 of the FTC Act, ensuring security of personal information from being viewed by unauthorized persons. [ER.2]</h4>
					<p>Section 5 of “Federal Trade Commission Act” or FTC Act prohibits the commerce of personal information without consent including information obtained through websites or applications. The act has also affirmed its authority under section
						8 of the FTC Act to take appropriate action when unfair practices or acts are discovered. </p>
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.5</span>Compliance with Section 5 of the FTC Act, ensuring fair competition and non-deceptive trade practices. [ER.2]</h4>
					<p>Section 5 of the FTC Act claims a joint statement that advertisers and publishers must be responsible for enforcing against unfair or deceptive trade practices as they apply to state-chartered banks. Moreover, the joint statement contains
						managing risks relating to Unfair & Deceptive Acts & Practices, or UDAP laws, and general guidance to avoid engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices.</p>
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.6</span>Compliance with the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), ensuring verification of age among all users. [ER.3]</h4>
					<p>The Child Online Privacy Protection Act or COPPA attempts to protect the privacy for all individuals of the age 13 years and younger, including children outside the USA. All software companies that are U.S based must be responsible
						for protecting children’s privacy and safety online including restrictions on marketing to children who are 13 years of age or younger.</p>
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.7</span>Third-Party licensing policies.</h4>
					<p>For each Third-Party product used within the application, attention must be given to avoid violating any policies or licensing terms. Each Third-Party product may have policies which are specific to itself, causing potential harm to
						the success of the application if not completely obliged to. </p>
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.8</span>Mobile device hardware.</h4>
					<p>The application will be limited to the hardware present on a single mobile device. This includes limitations on access to external storage, internal storage, and RAM. Otherwise, the application may slow down or crash a mobile device
						in use. </p>
					<h4><span class="id">PO.4.9</span>Optimal performance among all devices. [IR.8]</h4>
					<p>The application will be limited by aiming for suitable load speed times and data transfer times as outlined in the Laddering elicitation technique [IR.8]. From this elicitation data, it is understood that the sponsor prefers an application
						that is efficient and stable rather than an application with a wide variety of features that consumes a lot of space and may be susceptible to crashes.</p>

					<p>The input constraints verification defines the verification for the input constraints that fulfill the need for application security. The input constraints verification also verifies the enforcement of the sponsor’s guidelines to keep
						input-fields and conversations “very limited”. [IR.7] By verifying that we are limiting character input lengths, the risk of a buffer-overflow attack is mitigated. Additionally, we will verify that by limiting character input lengths
						and input formats, the application will follow the sponsor’s guidelines to prevent the application itself from being a place for people to talk, socialize, and get to know each other. [IR.7] </p>
