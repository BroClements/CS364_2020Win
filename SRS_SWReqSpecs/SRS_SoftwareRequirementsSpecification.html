         <p>The purpose of "Local Activity App" is to provide the users two
            way experience by allowing them to view and choose to
            participate in current activities or create and publish their

            the user can send a participation request, which must be
            approved by the activity owner. On the other hand, if the user
            choose to create their own activity, the user has the option to
            set that activity as a date or  determine a group participation
            size. Finally, the users can have access on a list of promotion
