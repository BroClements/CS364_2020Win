         <h1><span class="id">1</span>Introduction</h1>
         <p>Uvents is a mobile application that brings the community together by allowing</p>
         <div class="indent">
            <ul>
               <li>consumer users to create or participate in events, which can be set as a group event or a date event </li>
               <li>commercial users to list their promotions as an event, which can be seen by the personal users and added to their events</li>
               <li>admin users to manage general event policies, monitor user activity, and maintain the application</li>
            </ul>
            <a name="Purpose"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.1</span>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of Uvents is to provide personal users two-way
               experience by allowing them to choose to participate in events
               created by other users and create their own events.</p>
            <p>Additionally, consumer users can join and participate in events
               offered by local businesses. Uvents will receive revenue by
               having commercial users paying to have their events listed in the
               application.</p>
            <p>Uvents provides a convenient way for people to easily arrange
               local events, supports the local economy, and provides recreation
               in the local area.</p>

            <a name="Scope"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.2</span>Scope</h2>
            <p>Uvents is an application for people to post group events/dates and for
               people to find and join those group events/dates. Businesses can also pay for
               a select spot on the application for consumer users to view their events.</p>
            <p>The application will allow consumer users to: </p>
            <ul>
               <li>View events posted </li>
               <li>Join an event </li>
               <li>Chat with those in the group event to establish details </li>
               <li>Post a group event </li>
               <li>Post a one on one date with the opposite sex </li>
               <li>Post a group date for 4-6 couples </li>
               <li>Join a date </li>
               <li>The consumer user that posted the event/date would have
                  control of said event</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The application will allow commercial users to: </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Create events that feature their businesses </li>
               <li>Pay for select spots of where their business’ event will
                  appear</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Uvents will help people meet new friends while experiencing an
               event together. Uvents will also allow those consumer users to post
               a date or sign up for a date. Businesses will have the ability to
               promote their events for a price. The event promotion feature will
               create revenue from the application.</p>

            <a name="Poverview"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.3</span>Product Overview</h2>
            <p>Uvents will provide opportunities to meet new people while doing fun
               activities. Events will be able to be created by consumer and commercial
               users in order to facilitate these opportunities.</p>
            <p>Businesses can create events which can be joined by consumer users.
               Revenue from the app comes from business sponsored (prioritized or
               non-prioritized) promotions and business sponsored prioritized events.</p>
            <div class="indent">
               <a name="#Pperspective"></a>
               <h3><span class="id">PO.1</span>Product Perspective</h3>
               <p>The primary feature of Uvents is event and group event creation.</p>
               <p>The creation of group events has similarities to the calendar events
                  feature of Facebook. When consumer users create a group event, they can
                  then invite other consumer users to participate in the event. Consumer
                  users invited to a group event can RSVP for the event.</p>
               <p>A specific type of group event consumers can make are one-on-one dates
                  or group dates. Uvents has similarities to dating apps like Mutual. Unlike
                  most dating apps, Uvents focuses on helping people to find date ideas, and
                  plan the date itself.</p>
               <p>The creation of events comes from commercial users. These users can
                  create an event to promotes their business and post the event on the
                  application. The creation of these events will be like the creation of
                  group events, except the purpose will be for advertising and promoting
                  individual businesses. These commercial users will pay for a select spot
                  on the application from which they can post events.</p>

                        to update and manipulate. The Admin seeks to make the app profitable by attracting and retaining users and businesses. To retain users, it is crucial that the administrator can fulfil the needs of both users and businesses. </p>

        <p>Software verification is “the process of evaluating the development phase to ensure the accuracy of
            the software.”. [ER.5] The goal of software verification is to verify that all requirements are met by the
            software. The verifications will be separated into different steps in order to validate the different parts. Each
            verification statement will map to one requirement specifically. Each verification statement will include the
            testing technique, a method to accomplish that technique, and the workflow step. </p>

                   by limiting character input lengths and input formats, the application will follow the sponsor’s guidelines to
                   prevent the application itself from being a place for people to talk, socialize, and get to know each other.
