    <h2>Overview of the Technique</h2>
    <p>Introspection is the process in which someone looks at what is required and possible to complete the project. Through this process you can possibly gain a better understanding of what the properties and priorities are in order to have success. This process is mainly used as a starting point for other elicitation techniques. Because of the fact it is really on a starting point it is most effective in the people using it are familiar with what is wanted. [1]</p>
    <p>There are several advantages to this technique. The first being it is easy to use. This is because all it involves just looking and pondering on what you want to do. Secondly, there is no cost to it because it is all done just by think over what you want to do. Finally, it is very easy to move to a different technique. [1, 3]</p>
    <p>But like all thing there is always downsides to what they do. First, you cannot examine someone's inner thought son anything. Second, not everyone will be knowledge enough to be able to effectively be do this for every aspect of the project. Third, since no one has all the fact or information right away and can’t see into the future there could be a vital piece of information that you don’t have. Finally, this method does not allow for effective discussion during the process. [1, 3]</p>
    <p>Gould stated that there are two aspects to this technique. First is content or product and the second is process. Content has to do with what you are think and why are you think that way. While process is the how and when you get the thoughts or to those thought. Through these two methods you are using con-current and retrospective introspection.[3]</p>
    <p>Concurrent is when you follow consumption while it occurs. Its advantages are that you are mindfully observing what is happening. Thus, allowing the needed process to become readily available to you. Plus, you will be able to relive the process and what happens.[3]</p>
    <p>Retrospective is the process of remembering what happens at the various stages of consumption of the product. Thus, allow you to see what has allowed you to get to this point and to see where you still need to go. Allowing you to be able to predict how thing possible could play out. [3]</p>
    <p>Though the use of both types and the collaboration of the people using both you can resolve problems and issues before they occur. Also, what will happen is that the best possible path will become clearer to see by the group. Causing the project to improve and be better than it was previously would have been. Benefiting not just the uses but the creators of the project.</p>
    <h2>Technique Plan</h2>
    <h3>Plan Description</h3>
    <p>The team is going to introspect with themselves to come up with software requirements about the functionality of the app or about how specific features should be implemented in the app. They will use what they already know about the users and about programming to come up with these requirements. They will then meet up to determine the best requirements that each person came up with.</p>
    <h3>List of Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Introspect individually</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine 10 software requirements individually and write them down in a word document</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Report and follow up with the team about the software requirements</li>
        <li>Create a report based on the requirements learned by the team’s introspecting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finish introspecting by the end of the day on 5/13/2020</li>
        <li>Report and follow up with introspection at 12:45pm on 5/14/2020</li>
        <li>Turn report in by the end of 5/14/2020</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>External Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Word</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Correlated Data</h2>
    <p>In our introspection we all individually came up with 10 ideas and features to the app, we then condensed it to a list of 21 requirements that we will add to the project. These can be found in the section called Appendix: Raw Data. In order to narrow down the original list of 50 ideas we combined similar features and located the most unique ideas and created that list.</p>
    <p>One of the most important features that are required in the app is a strong security measure. Many users of similar products often have problems with stolen or fake user accounts, and, the team talked about utilizing facial recognition sign in as a solution to the problem.</p>
    <p>The team then chose to use Google Firestore to assist in most of the backend work of the application. Firestore’s utility allows developers a quick and easy way to program backend work that would be otherwise difficult or tedious. In its kit it has a way to host programs and websites, store data, and messaging, all of these will be especially helpful in developing the application.</p>
    <p>Push notification are an important part of any application that has any updates. It is especially helpful in this application where someone needs to to be often notified of any important updates. Those updates could be upcoming events, events that you might interested in, or messages from friends.</p>
    <p>A user rating system allows users to rate certain events that they thought were really good or really bad. Applying this system allows users to gain access to valuable and accurate information on the event that is occurring.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Introspection is a necessary aspect in planning any project. It allows for plans to be reliable and detailed. As people come together and look at what is required for the project and use the ideas and data collected, they can find the best solution in achieve the purpose of their project. In our project, we used introspection to really narrow down the ideas we got from our brainstorming session and amongst our own down time to find the most essential features for our application and how it will best influence the user.</p>
