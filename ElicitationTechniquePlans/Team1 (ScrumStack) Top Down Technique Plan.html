        <h1>Technique Plan </h1>
        <h2>Elicitation Technique: Top Down </h2>
        <h3>Technique Description: </h3>
        <p>
            The Top-Down Approach is a technique that produces specific
            requirements by breaking down a system to understand the details of a
            requirement. To begin, you start with some general or high-level features or
            requirements and then systematically brakes them down into increasingly
            smaller and more specific requirements. This assures that the resultant
            requirements are all focused on the main goals, and are specific enough to
            be easily implemented.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            This technique will provide a list of requirements in an ordinary
            matter from most general to most specific.  The implementation of this
            technique will benefit the project by finding the core requirements in the
            total scope of the project.

        </p>
        <h3>Carrying out the technique</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Identify a minimum of three high-level requirements</li>
            <li>Analyze requirements, breaking them down into more basic components</li>
            <li>Continue breaking down components until the most basic attributes are identified and collect the data from them </li>
            <li>Record into a word document and report findings</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Timeframe</h3>
        <ul class="unlabeled">
            <li>May 04, 2020 - Assign elicitation technique</li>
            <li>May 05, 2020 - Research elicitation technique                                              </li>
            <li>May 06, 2020 - Develop a plan to implement technique, Review plan by peer</li>
            <li>May 07, 2020 - Edit plan, Implement plan (Step 1)</li>
            <li>May 08, 2020 - Implement plan (Steps 2 - 4), Collect data from other reports, Analyze data </li>
            <li>May 09, 2020 - Write report</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data Analysis </h3>
        <p>
            We plan to review each other team’s elicitation techniques in order
            to develop a list of starting general requirements. We will break each of
            these starting points into smaller, more specific requirements. The
            requirements will be focused on “why” and “what.”
        </p>
        <h3>Follow Up</h3>
        <p>
            After implementing the plan and recording the data. The team will
            analyze the data and format it in an easy and understandable format.
        </p>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>
            Google Docs, other elicitation reports.
