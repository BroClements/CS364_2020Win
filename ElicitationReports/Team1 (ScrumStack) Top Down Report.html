        <h2 class="no-top-margin">Overview of the Technique</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3 class="no-top-margin">Technique: Top Down</h3>
            <p>
                The Top-Down Approach is a technique that produces specific
                requirements by breaking down a system to understand the details of a
                requirement. To begin, you start with some general or high-level features or
                requirements and then systematically break them down into increasingly
                smaller and more specific requirements. This assures that the resultant
                requirements are all focused on the main goals and are specific enough to be
                easily implemented.
            </p>
            <h3>Pros Regarding Top Down:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It helps align the project goals with customer expectations.</li>
                <li>
                    Provided a hierarchical requirement flows covering the details
                    of the requirements.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons Regarding Top Down:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Communication can easily become unclear. Vague requirements and
                    expectations can rapidly lead to confusions which can eventually
                    result in project failure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obscure requirements that do not directly fall in the scope of
                    one of the major requirements may be overlooked and left out of
                    the project scope.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Application to the Project:</h3>
            <p>
                This technique will provide a list of requirements in an ordinary
                matter from most general to most specific. The team has met together and
                broken down some of the requirements identified through other techniques as
                well some of the information provided on the application description. The
                implementation of this technique will benefit the project by finding the
                details of specific requirements of the application.

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Identify a minimum of three high-level requirements.</li>
                <li>
                    Analyze requirements, breaking them down into more basic
                    components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue breaking down components until the most basic
                    attributes are identified and collect the data from them.
                </li>
                <li>Record into a word document and report findings.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                We plan to review each other team’s elicitation techniques in order
                to develop a list of starting general requirements. We will break each of
                these starting points into smaller, more specific requirements. The
                requirements will be focused on “why” and “what.”
            </p>
            <h3>Follow Up</h3>
            <p>
                After implementing the plan and recording the data. The team
                will analyze the data and format it in an easy and
                understandable format.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The top down technique has provided the project with a set of unique
            requirements. By focusing first on the overall objective of the application
            and progressively breaking things down into smaller and more specific
            chunks, ultimately resulting in a set of basic requirements for the project.
            These requirements are critical to the success of the overall project.  The
            top down technique is effective in finding specific requirements that can be
            more easily implemented and ensures that the requirements all work together
            to accomplish the overall goal of the project.

                        Businesses can list events that they offer

                                Businesses compete (with price) to give priority to their events.

                        Users can post events that they are planning (this can consume business listings)
