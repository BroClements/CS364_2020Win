        <h2 class="no-top-margin">Overview of the Technique</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3 class="no-top-margin">Technique: Viewpoints</h3>
            <p> The viewpoints technique gathers requirements about a project by
                looking at the project from several different viewpoints. To be
                most effective it is important to identify as many relative
                viewpoints as possible and then discover the priorities each has
                in relation to the project. This creates a broader view of the
                requirements so that the finished product will fulfill the needs
                of all involved parties. This includes the users, customers,
                owners, developers, and anyone else who will be affected by the
                project. By taking all these varying viewpoints into account we
                avoid focusing on one aspect of the project to the exclusion and
                detriment of other parts of the project. After evaluating each
                viewpoint, it is possible that you will find conflicting
                priorities between two or more viewpoints. It is important to
                either discover a way to satisfy both priorities, or prioritize
                one viewpoints interest over that of another. </p>
            <h3>Pros Regarding Viewpoints:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensures that the needs and priorities of all people
                    involved with the project are met. </li>
                <li>Identifies a broad range of requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons Regarding Viewpoints:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be hard to convert the needs and priorities of any
                    specific viewpoint into specific actionable requirements.</li>
                <li>The technique may result in ignoring or downplaying
                    hitherto undiscovered audiences. </li>
                <li>The data gathered from viewpoints contains a certain degree
                    of ambiguity.  Data is either gathered through observation,
                    communication, or consideration of the challenges and
                    preferences of the viewpoint. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Application to the Project:</h3>
            <p> By applying this elicitation technique, we have identified
                differing priorities among the 4 viewpoints that we identified.
                Although we found a conflict of priorities between users and
                customers of the application, we have identified several ways to
                balance the priorities where they are at odds and thereby
                mitigate possible negative side effects. </p>

        <h2>Technique Plan</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3 class="no-top-margin">Purpose:</h3>
            <p> The view-point technique's purpose is to recognize the existence
                of multiples perspectives and provide a way to understand the
                conflicts in the requirements proposed by stakeholders. This
                technique will provide a better understanding of the
                requirements proposed by different parties interested in the
                application. </p>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Develop a list of five (5) unique viewpoints who may have
                    differing priorities. </li>
                <li>Identify their different perspective on the application and
                    turn those views points into a collection of data. </li>
                <li>Analyze those differences and record resulted in data into a
                    word document. </li>
                <li>Determine the requirements based on the analysis of the

            <h3>Follow Up</h3>
            <p> This technique requires little follow up. After defining the
                requirements, they will be recorded into the report. </p>

            followed. </p>
        <img alt="Correlated Data" src="./team1-resources/Viewpoints.png"/>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> We have been able to identify four key viewpoints for this
            application. They are as follows, maintenance and sustainability,
            the owner, user’s perspective, and company’s perspective. Each of
            these viewpoints identifies key parts of the app that will need to
            be present in order to ensure that the app is successful.</p>
        <p> The app needs to be easy to update overall. This should be done
            through ensuring that code is readable and easy to follow. The code
            should be designed in a way that it is both modular and polymorphic
            so that it is adaptable and easy to change. Good documentation
            should also be included throughout the code itself as well as in
            external documents to provide clear understanding of how it works.</p>
        <p> This app also needs to have a way to attract users as well as retain
            them, and it needs to be lucrative. From an owner’s perspective, they
            need to have a way to see data and statistics about the app,
            specifically the number of new users joining, retention levels, how
            users are finding out about the app, etc. Social media avenues should
            also be explored in order to increase publicity. The app should not be
            buggy so that users will not be frustrated. There must also be a
            sufficient diversity of activities to keep users interested and using
            the app. Generally, the upkeep of the app should be low so that
            profits can be maximized; and the app should also offer an easy way to
            refer new users.</p>
        <p> From a user’s perspective, the app needs to have quick and seamless
            transitions; it needs to be simple and quick to learn; and there needs
            to be a simple way for users to communicate one with another. To
            accomplish this, the server should be working asynchronously and
            should be fast enough to support many users at one time. There should
            also be tutorials in the app to educate new users. Activities should
            be easy to create and relevant ones should show up on the user’s feed.
            The UI should have a layout where tools and features are arranged in
            places where users would expect them to be.</p>
        <p> From a company’s perspective the apps should have a simple UI that
            allows business to get to bidding for slots quickly, as well as
            display informative data related to the company’s posting. This should
            be accomplished through a simple bidding interface and a dashboard
            where companies can view data briefly. Companies should also have a
            direct line of communication to the owner or a support center as well.
            Companies need an easy UI to create and list activities as well that
            should be different from the user’s option to create activities.</p>
        <p> There were a few conflicting viewpoints which we discovered as well.
            The first is that of user’s seeing relevant activities and the ones
            they want as opposed to the ones the companies have paid for. The
            resolution we recommend for this would be to have a general feed where
            activities show up for the user and on this activity the companies who
            have paid for slots will always have their postings listed first. From
            this general feed users would have the option to go to a settings menu
            and select a filter for relevant activities which would then show them
            things more relevant to them. This would satisfy both demands.</p>
