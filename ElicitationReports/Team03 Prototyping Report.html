   <div class="indent">
      <h3 class="no-top-margin">Technique: Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
         Software prototyping is a critical part of the software engineering process. Software prototyping is defined
         as a model for software development in which a prototype is built, displayed, and reworked as needed until
         an acceptable prototype is achieved. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Prototypes are available in many forms. Among the most popular is wireframing. Wireframing is an illustration
         that represents a static outline and is symbolic of a user interface. Wireframes are used to point our
         basic functionality while eliciting design and logic preferences from the stakeholders. [1]
      </p>

      <h3>Pros Regarding Prototyping:</h3>
      <p>
         Prototyping provides many different advantages. With Prototyping “you get the chance to test your product way
         before you actually start working on it and address any key pain points in advance.” [2] It also “helps you
         test your ideas early on and make changes before you and your team have done a lot of expensive work.” [2] It
         cuts away time that would have been wasted on bad planning or miscommunication. This is also a great way to get
         an impression of what the user or stakeholder on the design and flow of the product. They can give meaningful
         feedback to the developers, which will cause production to run smoother and quicker. 
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Save company money</li>
         <li>Get a visual guide </li>
         <li>Create a more realistic timeline </li>
         <li>Acknowledge problems</li>
         <li>Valuable user feedback </li>
         <li>You get to innovate</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cons Regarding Prototyping:</h3>
      <p>
         On the other hand, prototyping can be time consuming. In addition, if the designer’s “knowledge is limited, it
         may not be possible to estimate the difficulty degree of implementation and will cause unlimited development
         time.” [3]
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Can be time consuming</li>
         <li>Can be ineffective in estimating the difficulty degree of implementation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Application to the Project:</h3>
      <p>
         To design a valid prototype, various preliminary decisions had to be made. This included decisions such as what
         type of prototype to design (ex. Low Fidelity or High Fidelity), what software to use, and the scope of the
         overall prototype. Since there was only one week allotted to design the prototype, it was necessary to limit
         the scope of the prototype rather than try to cover every possible scenario of the application. The scope was
         narrowed to include the entire business owner dashboard for the application, along with a minor portion to
         demonstrate how end-users will view published information from businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
         Using data that was previously collected, we were able to apply it to our prototype. We were able to brainstorm
         and create models for our prototype that best suited what our final product would look like and how it would
         interact with other models and the user.  
      </p>
      <p>
         Upon completion of the prototype, the design was then sent to the sponsor for review. Any changes outlined by
         the sponsor were implemented before the final prototype was submitted. The data gathered from this
         elicitation technique will provide a clear functionality reference while writing the SRS and SDD. 
      </p>

   <h2>Technique Plan</h2>
   <div class="indent">
      <h3 class="no-top-margin">Elicitation Technique: Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
          Software Prototyping is defined as a model for software development in which a prototype is built, displayed
         and reworked as needed until an acceptable prototype is achieved.[4] Therefore, the purpose of our Software
         Prototype will be to build an example demonstration as part of the software development process
         and to give an outline of all the required information for the user interface.

      </div>
      <h4>Stakeholders and Customers</h4>
      <p>
         The stakeholder is Jordan Hamblin. Our customers are business owners. Businesses who post on the app will
         be funding it. 
      </p>

      <h4>Timeframe</h4>
      <p>
          The total time to research, plan, and report on this elicitation technique will be less than one week. The
         planning document will be completed by Monday, May 11th. The prototype will be drafted by Wednesday evening on
         May 13th, so it can be reviewed by the sponsor. The final revised report will be completed by Saturday
         afternoon, May 16th. 
      </p>
      <h4>Collected Data</h4>
      <p>
         The data collected for this elicitation technique will be the finished prototype. This prototype will serve as
         a basis for determining further requirements for the application. 
      </p>

      <h3>Technique</h3>
      <p>
         The technique for developing a wireframe is fairly straightforward. During previous weeks, requirements data
         was gathered through elicitation techniques such as interviews and surveys. This data will be compiled and
         used to determine core functionalities of the application. 
      </p>
      <p>
          From these core functionalities, ideas for necessary screens will brainstormed and written on paper. Next,
         actual wireframes will be created on Lucidchart with reference to the brainstormed paper concepts. The design
         of these wireframes will take meticulous consideration to ensure usability.  
      </p>
      <p>
         Upon completion of the wireframes, they will then be sent to the sponsor. This is a critical step of the
         technique, since it is requisite for the sponsor to deem the wireframes adequate for the final project.  
      </p>

            <h4>Prototyping Steps</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>1.  Compile Previous Elicitation Data</li>
               <li>2.  List out Essential Functionalities</li>
               <li>3.  Create Outlines from  Functionalities</li>
               <li>4.  Create Screen Designs on Lucidchart from Outlines</li>
               <li>5.  Share Designs with sponsor for review</li>
               <li>6.  Finalize Designs</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>External Tools Used</h4>
            <p>
               The web tool Lucidchart will be used to design the wireframe prototypes. 
            </p>
         </div>
         <h3>Analyzing the Data</h3>
         <p>
            We will be analyzing data such as our task analysis from last week and other data collected in previous
            weeks to create our prototype of the app layout. For example, the task analysis broke down the high-level
            goal of this app into smaller tasks and sub-tasks, all the way down to individual features. Using that
            information, we will be better prepared to brainstorm each screen of the app for our prototype.
         </p>
         <p>
            From the wireframes created during this elicitation technique, a clear outline of required functionalities
            and screens will be presented. This will be essential during the creation of the SRS and SDD, since it will
            provide precise examples of required features.
         </p>
      </div>






      <h2>Correlated Data</h2>
      <p>
          In order to provide a well thought out prototype, the scope of the elicitation was required to be limited. In
         order to narrow the scope, we focused on the business owner side of the application.
      </p>
      <p>
         The following data highlights main functionalities required by business owners. For practical reasons, the
         entire prototype will not be listed displayed here, but should be viewed at <a
            href="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/804aba42-0f1c-479b-a24b-220a6ac443a2">this link</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>1.) Business Login & Dashboard</h4>
      <p>
         This is the first thing a business owner will see when they open the app. From here, they will be able to
         either log in or create an account, then navigate to different parts of the app.
      </p>

         title="Prototype Screens">
      <h4>2.) Business Profile Creation</h4>
      <p>
         This set of screens is for creating a new business account. We will require personal, business and payment
         information (for monthly bids). There will also be an account approval process to verify that these accounts
         belong to real businesses.
      </p>
      <img src="./team3-resources/Business_Profile_Creation.png" alt="Business Profile Creation Prototype Screens"
         title="Prototype Screens">
      <h4>3.) Create Activity Screens</h4>
      <p>
         This is where a business will create the activity they want to share. Created activities will be available for
         users to create events with and will be able to be bid on by the creator.
      </p>
      <img src="./team3-resources/Create_Activity_Screens.png" alt="Create Activity Screens Prototype Screens" title="Prototype Screens">
      <h4>4.) Promote Activity Screens</h4>
      <p>
         These screens are where the business owner will manage promoting their activity. They will be able to see and
         take part in monthly bids and share their activity.
      </p>
      <img src="./team3-resources/Promote_Activity_Screens.png" alt="Promote Activity Screens Prototype Screens"
         title="Prototype Screens">
      <h4>5.) Metrics Screens</h4>
      <p>
         On these screens, business owners will be able to see different data about their activities, events and
         attendees for their activities, ratings, and spending.
      </p>
      <img src="./team3-resources/Metrics_Screens.png" alt="Metrics Screens Prototype Screens" title="Prototype Screens">
      <h4>6.) End-User View of Business Details</h4>
      <p>
         These screens are how the end-user will interact with the business. End-users will be able to see a list of
         current activities, ordered by the amount each business bid for that month. Clicking one of these activities
         will display more details and give the option to create or join an event. Clicking ‘info’ by the business name
         will take the user to the business’s profile.

      <h4>Data Insights</h4>
      <p>
         There are several items to note from these prototypes. First is the scope of this technique being less
         concerned with design, and more concerned with usability. From previous elicitation techniques, the features
         shown in this prototype were all previously determined to be necessary.

      </p>
      <p>
         The second portion of our research (image 6) was concerned with how end-users will view information presented
         from business owners. This includes the main list view page, individual event views, and business profiles.
      </p>





      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
         For our technique, prototyping, we were able to create a rough visual representation of what the final app will
         look like. To accomplish this, we took the ideas from our task analysis and created a wireframe based off the
         tasks that had been outlined. From there we created and organized all the screens in categories to represent
         how the users, both businesses and individuals, will interact with the app.
      </p>
      <p>
         By completing our wireframe prototype, we were able to break down the features needed on each screen in order
         to enhance the user’s experience, and we were better able to understand the needs of the user.
      </p>
      <p>
         We recommend the implementation of all features listed in our wireframe prototype, in connection with approval
         from the sponsor. For practical reasons, these features will not be listed here, but should be referenced in
         the correlated and raw data sections.
      </p>
      <p>
         We conclude that although this is only a prototype of the screens in the app, it will be beneficial for the
         sponsor to see and the progress of the overall project.
      </p>
