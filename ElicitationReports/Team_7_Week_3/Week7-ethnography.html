    <h1>Ethnography Report</h1>
    <h2>Overview of the Technique</h2>
    <p>“Ethnography is a collection of qualitative methods used in the social sciences that focus on the close observation of social practices and interactions.” [1] Ethnography helps discover system requirements that reflect the culture and the ways that people work, rather than the processes defined by the company or organization. [2] By immersing into environments where the app will be used, additional requirements can be discovered.</p>
    <p>“Ethnography is one of the early qualitative approaches and is concerned with learning about people, in contrast to studying people” [3] One of the most crucial aspects of ethnography is the actual learning about the people, their needs, and their operations.</p>
    <p>The study technique of ethnography has proven beneficial in many industries. In school it helps students become more understanding of people’s differences in race, religion, culture, mannerisms, and political beliefs. In a business sense, ethnography can provide companies with valuable insights that may help them design and create products that are more attractive to a larger market group with higher conversions. This type of research has also helped scientists’ understanding of the human behavior regardless of where they’re from, culture, religion or educational background</p>
    <p>There are many different possible methods for implementing ethnography. Some of which are complete observer, observer-as-participant, participant-as-observer, and complete participant. [3] Each of these implementations involves a different level of interaction amongst those being observed. Being a complete observer means that there is no interaction between the observer and the participants. The observer-as-participant has a brief amount of interaction with the participants. Participant-as-observer is when the observer tries to integrate with the participants, but the observer informs them that they are being studied. The last one, complete participant, is when the observer completely immerses themselves among participants without letting them know about the research they are doing. [3] Perhaps one of the most traditional methods of implementing ethnography is by collecting facts, information, and data, about the culture being studied through detached observation. [4]</p>
    <p>Each of the different methods has pros and cons. Some methods can alter the accuracy of the data because some participants may act differently if they know that they are being observed. It is not fully possible for the observer to fully separate themselves from their bias, and some of these methods make it easier for the observer to include more of their bias [3, 5].</p>
    <p>One item to note with ethnography is, it requires a lot of time and labor. The process is extensive and is heavily reliant on the ethnographer to develop a relationship with his subjects. The individuals must become comfortable with the ethnographer to allow open and honest discussions. When these conditions are met, this type of research gains incredible amounts of worth and can provide lots of benefits for the research group.</p>

    <h2>Technique Plan</h2>
    <p>Ethnography is a study through close observation of the subject. In this case, the subject will be similar applications to that of the sponsor’s idea. The team decided to immerse themselves into the following applications: MeetUp, Blendr, Meet Me, Nearby, and Facebook Events. Each individual was assigned to research, download, and take notes on the users and the culture of one of the above applications. These notes were taken before 12:45 pm on May 8, 2020. The report is to be created and turn in by the end of May 9, 2020.</p>
    <p>The report would answer the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How users like the user interface and its ease of use?</li>
        <li>How users like the design of the app?</li>
        <li>What features do the users find useful?</li>
        <li>What features do users generally enjoy?</li>
        <li>If applicable, what is the review score?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Microsoft Word and smartphones were used as external tools for collecting the relevant information.</p>
    <h2>Correlated Data</h2>
    <p>As the data shows there is a market out there for this type of app but one of the biggest issues is that many people keep having the app crash or there are many scams that happen on the app. Which have caused the apps to have an average rating of 3 to 4 stars out of five. A reoccurring pro is that it has a simple interface and the easy of which the functions can be used.</p>
    <img src="images/image1.png">
    <p>Based on the data in order to have a successful app you must be able to have a quick response time to be able to fix issues and remove the fake or scam profiles from the app. Which would require to have someone or a group of people who job was to solo investigate and deal with any of those problems that will occur. Doing so will insure the best possible rating from the customers.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Ethnography is a very effective way of collecting information and being able to focus a specific population group and is a very strong Elicitation Requirement Technique. It is using different social sciences to figure out the best possible product or process that goes well with an average user. Ethnography was successfully executed. We gathered a lot of usable data and ideas to improve upon the proposed model and the data gained can be useful in the SRS and SDD. </p>
