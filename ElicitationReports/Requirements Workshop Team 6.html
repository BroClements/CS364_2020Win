        <div class="indent">
            <p>
                This report details the process of the requirements workshop and the planning 
                and results of the workshop. The report will focus on the overview of the technique, 
                planning, raw data, and concluding information on the requirements workshop. This 
                report is meant to further explain the requirements workshop elicitation technique, 
                and the results that were gathered by employing this technique.
            </p>
            <p>
                The requirements workshop is meant to provide a channel for both 
                the sponsor and the stakeholders to all meet and develop requirements 
                for the project to be created. According to Didar Zowghi, Associate 
                Professor of Software Engineering, and Chad Coulin, member of the 
                Requirements Engineering research group in the Faculty of Information 
                Technology at the University of Technology, Sydney,  “the emphasis is 
                on developing and discovering requirements for a software system [1].” 
                Requirement workshops are meant to increase communication and collaboration 
                among the stakeholders of the project. The workshops held are the beginning of 
                a creative process with the goal of producing new applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                The elicitation technique workshop is one of the many elicitation techniques 
                used to build and implement requirements. Workshop is convenient when distinguish 
                stakeholder groups are enrolled in the project. The sessions are conducted by a facilitator 
                and attended by project representatives and specialists from each one of the involved groups who 
                plan meetings to discuss and to work on the implementation of project requirements. Neil Maiden, 
                who is Professor of Digital Creativity in the Faculty of Management at the Cass Business and 
                co-founder of the Centre for Creativity in Professional Practice at City University London, said 
                that “One of the obvious advantages of using group workshops is the ability to integrate other 
                elicitation techniques into them, and then to incorporate their combined usage into a deﬁned 
                requirements process [2].”

        <h2>Requirement Workshop: Plan</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>The purpose of the requirements workshop is to establish the requirements for the
                 application that is to be developed. This will essentially provide a set of goals 
                 that the team will have to achieve when developing the application [1].
                </p>
            <h4>Contributors</h4>

                <li>Sponsor: Jordan Hamblin</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Stakeholders and Customers</h4>
            <p>Stakeholders: Jordan Hamblin (sponsor)</p>
            <p>Customers: Local businesses, local residents, students</p>
            <h4>Timeframe</h4>
            <p>The workshop will be held Thursday, April 30, 2020 at 4:00PM.</p>
            <h4>Collected Data</h4>
            <p>We will collect data about what the stakeholder’s vision is, his target audience, 
                what features, and what type of businesses he is targeting.</p>
            <h4>Technique</h4>
            <p>
                We have prepared a list of questions we want to ask the sponsor. The questions are the following: 
                What is the sponsor’s vision for the project? What are features that you would like to see on the 
                app? What type of businesses are you targeting what is your audience? What is the scope of the project? 
                View current activities, create new activities, is this app free? What should be allowed for each user? 
                Who can use this app? Who is going to have access to it?
            </p>

        <h2>Analyzing the Data</h2>
        <p>On 5/1/2020 we will meet as a team and look over the data received from the meeting. 
            From there we will decide which member of the team will write each portion of the report. </p>
        <h2>Raw Data</h2>
        <p>On 5/1/2020 we will meet as a team and look over the data received from the meeting. From there we will decide which 
            member of the team will write each portion of the report. </p>
        <div>
            <p>From the workshop, several requirements were defined. Speaking for the Activities App as a whole, 
                the sponsor stated that the app should be available free of charge. To begin with, these are some 
                of the core requirements for the app as a whole:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>App is free to download and create an account</li>
                <li>App is offered only through iOS (initially)</li>
                <li>Target users will be residents and students in Rexburg, Idaho (initially)</li>
                <li>Target users are young adults (ages 18-26), but other age groups may also use the app</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                The workshop also discovered that the Activities App will have two classes of users, those 
                representing local businesses and those who represent only themselves as people seeking to participate in activities. 
                As the data is presented, these will be referred to as “businesses” and “personal users” respectively. Each of their 
                roles are outlined as follows:
            </p>
            <h4>Businesses</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Able to create activities to take place at their place of business.</li>
                <li>Pay to have their activities promoted. Highest-bidding business has activity listed at the top of the list and so forth.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Personal Users</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Never charged money by the app</li>
                <li>Upon account creation, must supply gender, age, etc.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can also sign up through Facebook, Google, etc. if desired</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Able to browse a list of activities presented by businesses</li>
                <li>Able to browse a list of events created by personal users seeking other personal users to join their events
                    <ul>
                        <li>A “Random” button is also present. Upon clicking this button, the personal user would be presented with 
                            a randomly selected event where the event creator is seeking participants.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Able to create an event (events are different from activities, which are created by businesses)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Event will be linked to a business’s activity</li>
                        <li>Able to select the desired number of participants, which will cause the event to be viewable by other personal users</li>
                        <li>Able to select that the event is a “date” (which would require one additional participant of the opposite gender)</li>
                        <li>After event creation, able to reject requests by other personal users to join the event</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Able to interact with other personal users
                    <ul>
                        <li>Able to add other personal users to a network of friends (it is unknown what these will eventually be referred to as, 
                            but here they will be referred to as “network friends”); this can be done after participating in an event with the other personal user</li>
                        <li>Able to send direct messages to network friends</li>
                        <li>Able to report a personal user who has bailed on (i.e. didn’t show up to) an event they had signed up to attend</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The sponsor also had several ideas about how requirements might change in the future of the app (if it does well when implementing its initial 
                requirements). These are not current requirements, but they may be useful to consider while architecting the app initially.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>App would potentially be available on platforms other than iOS (e.g. Android)</li>
                    <li>Instead of targeting users only in the Rexburg area, app would target users in a wider geographical range</li>
                    <li>Geographic proximity to personal user would be considered when showing available activities and events. E.g. 
                        a Salt Lake City user may not want to see an event happening in Rexburg.</li>
                    <li>Personal user would be able to invite network friends to the personal user’s created events</li>
                    <li>Geographic proximity on a small scale (even to how many feet away another personal user is) would allow users 
                        to be made aware of events currently happening nearby or when other personal users are nearby. This might be done 
                        either through push notifications, or just when the app is open and/or this information is requested.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Correlated Data</h2>
        <p>This technique did not collect any correlated data.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This report has detailed the process of the requirements workshop, the plan that was created before the requirement workshop 
            occurred, and the results of the performed elicitation technique. The requirement workshop has helped to provide requirements 
            for the application that will help contribute to other documents that will be made for this application. </p>
        <p>The requirements workshop also helped to create a channel of communication with the sponsor; this is a channel of communication that 
            must be maintained for the duration of the project. Further requirements workshops should be performed many more times as needed to 
            ensure the application has all the components it needs to be a success.</p>
