        <h2 class="no-top-margin">Overview of the Technique</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>The observation elicitation technique is used to observe how a product is doing by observing the reactions of users, stakeholders, and workers. Observers can get a good grasp on how the product is currently performing. Taking users’ and employees’ feedback is very important, as users can explain the product’s strengths and weaknesses. Employees can make the product more efficient by cutting out unnecessary features and making better use of resources.</p>
            <p>Observing the users,including the intended users, of the product in the environment in which it will be used helps us get context for the product and better understand what is really needed in the design.</p>
            <p>This technique allows us to see the product at work, or rather, see how the user interacts with the product. A side effect, however, is that people tend to act differently when they know they are being observed.</p>
            <p>When understanding what our sponsor wants, it is important to know not only his or her needs for our product but also how he or she wants all aspects of the product to turn out. The observation elicitation technique is using observation to get that required information from the sponsor. Understanding how the sponsor runs his or her business or workspace greatly affects how the design of the product will turn out. “...sometimes stakeholders say what they should do instead of what they really do. Stakeholders at the managerial level are usually interviewed, even though the agreed requirements do not always reflect the final users’ real needs.” Observation methods can help in uncovering work practices, so employees must be observed in their natural workplace environment, engaging in natural activities [17]. As we understand how the sponsor acts in his or her natural workspace, we also understand his or her character and needs and then can apply that to the desired design.</p>
            <p>The observation elicitation technique can be applied to personal gains as well. Watching an experienced worker allows the observer to learn skills and use what he or she observes to improve him- or herself. There are a few types of observation: active and passive. Active observation involves asking questions to the observed person. This allows the observer to get feedback on anything he or she is confused about. However, this method disrupts the person’s workflow and will make him or her less productive. Passive observation involves simply watching the person work. This will allow the observer to see how the person works and it does not disrupt his or her workflow. This method does not allow interaction, so the observer will not be able to address his or her questions.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>From our observations, we have understood that our sponsor would like the application to be developed as follows:</p>
            <p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
    		The layout should have a ‘glass card’ app and a ‘mutual’ app feel to it. It is a place where businesses can post activities as well as show deals that they may have going on. Users will be able to host events at a business location and choose; party size, accept or reject invitee, recurring event, and the time of the event/meeting place. Premium users will be able to see business deals, while free users may not see those deals, or only see limited deals from businesses.</p>
            <p><strong>Flow</strong><br>
    		The application is based around what seem like two parts: business-based events and user-based events. Business events will come from the business profile where their events and deals/offers can be seen. When looking up business events or deals, business order will be based on how much the business pays to be sponsored and will be listed in descending ranking. User-based events will be when a user creates an event, which can be looked up according to interest from the other users.</p>
            <p><strong>Casual</strong><br>
    		The app should have a casual feel. This should be an app that people can meet up with others who share similar interests. There will be a user profile that has basic activity interest information.</p>
            <p><strong>Contact limited</strong><br>
    		There should be limited chat functions in the app besides the more needed: ‘do you need a ride’ etc... chat functions. The purpose of this is for people to meet face to face with those who have similar interests and get to know each other through talking, rather than through chatting online. There will be an option to follow, friend, or save the profile of someone who you have been in contact with so the user can re-invite them to events.</p>
            <p><strong>Modularity</strong><br>
    		The flow, design, and feel of the app will be changed by business and user preference. If there is more of a need to have chat options, or if there is more of a need for a map or location/GPS options those may be added. There will need to be space for the application to grow, change, and expand.</p>
