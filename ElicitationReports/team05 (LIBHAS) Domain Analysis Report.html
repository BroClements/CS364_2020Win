		<h2 class="no-top-margin">Overview of the Technique</h2>
		<div class="indent">
			<h3 class="no-top-margin">Technique: Top Down</h3>
			<p>
				Domain Analysis is a technique to see what others have done to produce solutions similar to the target solution.
				It can typically be broken into four steps: Identifying similar software; gathering data from said software;
				analysing said data to find what is useful; and applying said knowledge to our project in such a way that it
				follows legal and ethical standards. Using this technique will allow for the creation of a standard or template
				from the data collected that can be reused on our project and future ones. This has the perks of faster development,
				by providing more stable code as a foundation for additional work. It will also help provide a better product as
				the analysis can also provide insight into challenges that the product might face. In step 1, the main hurdle is
				choosing the correct domain and not conflating ideas. This is done by finding a system or software that can be 
				sufficiently generalized for your purposes. In the process of step 2 it is very important to carefully identify the 
				applicable operations and objects. This can be completed after the team has a good understanding of the problem that
				they are trying to solve and the pieces that would solve it. During step 3, making the data mean something can
				sometimes be tricky, after extraction the data needs to be organized and presented in a way that is understandable
				and therefore reusable. If the first three steps have been done to the fullest extent, then step 4 should be easy.
				Application of a model to the software being designed is one of the simplest steps in the process. This is made much
				more difficult if there was a fault earlier down the line, if the objects chosen do not fit project needs then the
				analysis has been a failure.

			<h3>Stakeholders and Customers</h3>
			<p>A stakeholder is Jordan Hamblin and possible other investors. The customers will be local businesses that will use the app, and the people creating activities.</p>
			<h3>Carrying out the technique</h3>
			<p>
				For this week, we will research the Domain Analysis technique. Our purpose is to be better prepared for the project
				by analyzing data from other apps that might be related to our project. By applying Domain Analysis we will be able
				to know the latest trends regarding the application field as well as the features that might be used in the application.
				We will be collecting data by researching other applications individually and writing the findings into the same Google
				document. The data will consist of findings regarding possible application features related to functionality, design,
				and esthetics. As we research the information regarding other applications, we will take notes and will record
				everything online in Google Docs. [1]
			</p>
			<p>The way we will implement the technique will be the following:</p>
			<ul class="unlabeled">
				<li>Research the Web to find application with similar functionality that the featured app will have</li>
				<li>Identify two applications that will be the best fit comparing to our app</li>
				<li>Make a list of both functional and design features that will be useful in the app based on the sponsor description</li>
				<li>Make a list of both functional and design features that will be useful in the app based on the sponsor description</li>
				<li>Document all the features and possible ways and/or technologies to accomplish them</li>
				<li>Combine everything into one Google document and prepare for the team review</li>
				<li>After the review, submit the findings</li>
				<li>Further, combine the findings from the Domain Analysis technique with other techniques and implement them in the application</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Timeframe</h3>
			<p>All the information will be investigated upon the plan approval on Wednesday, May 6, with the deadline to finish and combine all findings into a Google doc by the night of Friday, May 8. The final report will be available on Saturday, May 9. </p>
		</div>
		<h2>Correlated Data</h2>
		<p>
			A list of features that would be good to include in our project's functionality would include,but is not limited to the following:
			<o1>
				<li>a map api, probably using Google Maps, with additional custom locations for activities</li>
				<li>functionality to link to other social media accounts</li>
				<li>an integrated calendar and support for external calendars</li>
				<li>links to other apps to allow for ease of acces with various aspects of the activities, such as calendaring, transportation, catering, etc.</li>
			</o1>

		</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			In conclusion, Many of the features that we will look to incorperate into the app may best be individually outsourced to other free programs or api's.
			Doing so will reduce development requirements and upkeep, and may allow access to greater resources than we could handle on the company sponsered server.
		</p>

		<h2>Appendix: Raw data collected</h2>

		<p>
			Google Maps - This is the best maps API that would be great to use for adding, removing, and searching events. From this
			screenshot, the most I would love to highlight is the opportunity to search for items on the map (in our case - events).
			After user searches, all nearby events qualifying to that search query will show on the screen and if a user clicks on
			them, a small slide window will be displayed on the bottom of the page to let the user see brief (expanded) information
			about the event. Also it will be a good idea to use Google API in regards to layers, street view, current location, etc. [2]
		</p>
		<p>
			HangTime - the only good thing in this application was the opportunity to log in with Facebook or phone credentials. It
			might be more convenient for users to use these means to register because first, it’s easier and second, they can link
			friends from 1)Facebook or 2)their contact list (upon their permission). [3]
		</p>
		<p>
			Virtlo - This application fascinated me by their feature to have a ‘radar’ of the nearby events that is available via
			camera (picture to the left). I think it would be a great addition to our application (if that’s possible to accomplish
			for both Android and iOS). Second, this application has a great idea what to include into the registration form: Full
			Name, Email, username, password, Phone Number. These are the things we might want.Another thing that I liked was a
			category list. Since there will be multiple events, most of them will belong to different categories and it would be
			a great opportunity for users to select the categories they are interested in which will display the results on the map. [4]
		</p>
		<p>
			SeeU - this application wasn’t a great source of insights yet it had two different bars - first is the left bar which can
			slide-in and slide-out to display the available categories with the opportunity to choose between them. Second is the 
			upper navigation bar which can be also put on the bottom of the screen. There you can: Open the sidebar; Edit your profile
			info (reset password); Read Safety Tips; See all conversations/events; Add an event; These are the domain analysis features
			I thought would be best applicable to our application. There are hardly any applications with the functionality we are
			building so this collective data might help us build the best application for the users. [5]
		</p>
		<p>
			24me - Because our software will be planning the event, I think the most important thing is that the basic understanding
			of the events I think we need to have an integrated calendar so that users can check the schedule one time. It also has
			to-do lists and notes. If you set up the schedule, it will send a reminder notification. Also, you can check the price
			on the application. [6]
		</p>
		<p>
			Google Map(Uber service) - I think there are people who want to attend the event but do not have a ride to get there.
			In that case, if we can put a functionality to get a ride on the app, they may be able to get a ride easily. They do
			not have to get the Google Map or Uber app to get a ride. And also, we can put a functionality to share the gas fee
		</p>
		<p>
			Zimride - An American rideshare program that matches inter-city drivers and passengers through private social networks.
			If the drivers decide to attend the event and have a spot, they can post on the application so that riders can take it
			and they can share the fee such as gas or entrance fee etc. But the one that I am worried about is that it is hard to
			check the background. We have information of users but it would not be enough to check whether drivers are qualified
			to give a ride. So, I would suggest that if someone wants to be a driver, they may need to give additional information
			for background check.
		</p>
		<p>
			Event Ready - Full-Service event registration & management software for medium to large events that need customized
			tools & have a special process. They boast management software that helps you keep track of who and what is going on
			during an event. This seems like it could be a very useful software to constructing events.
