        <div class="indent">
            <p>CRC (Class Responsibility Collaborator Cards) act very similar to how classes interact in a UML deign. An example of what a card would look like is shown in Figure 1.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan=2>Class Name</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Responsibilities</td>
                    <td>Collaborators</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <span>Fig 1: An example of card information placement.</span>
            <p>There are three parts to a CRC; the Class Name, Responsibilities and Collaborators.</p>
            <p>A class represents a collection of similar objects, [1] this can be a person, place, thing or idea. This is
what the card is centered around.</p>
            <p>A responsibility is anything that a class knows or does.[1] This describes the information that the class
holds. </p>
            <p>When a class has a role or responsibilities to fulfill but does not have the resources or information to do
so it has collaborators. Just like how in a UML diagram classes interact to share information and data the
CRC has collaborators to help it fulfill its roles. </p>
            <p>An example of different CRC’s can be seen in Figure 2.</p>

            <p>Class Responsibility Collaboration is a technique to better envision different classes in object-oriented
programming. Often used with cards, this approach allows programmers to step away from the oftenlimiting procedural mode of thought in order to appreciate the flow of objects in programming. A single
CRC card is used to represent an object class [2]. The name of the class goes onto the top of the card,
responsibilities of the class goes on the left side, and the collaborators with the class goes on the right
side. The name of the class can be anything you want, but usually the name is indicator of what the
object will do (Ex: Student). Responsibilities involves something that the class knows or does (Ex: A
Student has a name; a student can change their classes). collaborators are other classes that interact
with the class in order to fulfill its responsibilities (Ex: A student interacts with their teachers; a student
interacts with their counselor). Using CRC cards in this way allows programmers to see the big picture
and how classes relate to one another [3].</p>
            <p>“The ability to quickly organize and spatially address index cards proves most valuable when a design is
incomplete or poorly understood. We have watched designers repeatedly refer to a card they intended
to write by pointing to where they will put it when completed.</p>
            <p>Design with the cards tends to progress from knowns to unknowns, as opposed to top-down or bottom
up. We have observed two teams arriving at essentially the same design through nearly opposite
sequences, one starting with device drivers, the other with high-level models. The problem demanded a
certain set of capabilities which both teams discovered in the course of fulfilling the requirements of the
design.”[4]
</p>
            <p>Rather than remain in a procedural mode of thought CRC cards encourage people to embrace a more
object-oriented form of collaboration [5]. Many people criticize CRC cards for a lack of written design;
however, because they make designs seem obvious, written designs are normally not necessary unless a
more permanent record be required, in which case one card for each class can be written out in full and
retained as documentation [5].</p>

        <h2>Technique Plan</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <ol>
                <li>Using the information we collected on the app from previous techniques, we plan to
each come up with 2 different CRC’s (Thursday)</li>
                <li>Fill out CRC responsibilities and collaborators for other teammates (Friday)</li>
                <li>Review CRC’s as a group (Friday)</li>
                <li>Follow up: Send CRC card ideas to other teams to see what feedback they have</li>
            </ol>
