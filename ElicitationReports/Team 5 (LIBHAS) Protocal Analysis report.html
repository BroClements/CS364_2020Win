			<h3 class="no-top-margin">Technique: Protocol Analysis</h3>
			<p>
				Protocol Analysis refers to the collection of data by observing individuals and their thought processes. This observation is typically done by the individual in order to refine their thought process. This is usually done by having the individual speak out loud as they go over their problems, ideas, and plans. This process can also be documented either by a transcriber or by recording either audio or video, for future reference either for the intent of gaining a solution to the same or similar problem, or as data analysis on the psychological process of finding the solution.

			<h3>Stakeholders and Customers</h3>
			<p>A stakeholder is Jordan Hamblin and possibly other investors. The customers will be local businesses that will use the app, and the people creating activities.</p>
			<h3>Carrying out the technique</h3>
			<p>Since the whole point of the technique is to either individually or as a group to physically gather together and discuss ideas out-loud, due to the lack of such opportunity, it is difficult to accomplish such an experiment in a group online. Thus, it will be performed individually. Each team member will be given a part of the suggested project requirements and will need to say them out loud and discuss with themselves whether they are good or bad for the project. All brainstorming ideas while speaking out loud will be recorded in Google Docs and will be attached in the data section. Customers and stakeholders will not be identified at this point in the research but eventually, this data will get to the stakeholders. Here is the suggested plan for applying the protocol analysis elicitation technique: Identify three team members who will be research participants; Collect the suggested project requirements from other teams and evenly distribute them between the team members from the following documents:</p>

			</u1>
			<p>Each team member will: Read each requirement out loud; Say out loud the advantages and disadvantages of that requirement; Write a note in Google Docs whether this requirement will be beneficial for the project or whether we need to consider removing it or replacing it; Proceed to the next requirement until all of them are ‘discussed’. Upon completion, all data will be collected by Team Lead into one Google Doc then the Chief Editor will compile a report based on the research findings. All the research results will go to the Project Manager as well as Course Instructor for further use.</p>
			<h3>Timeframe</h3>
			<p>The suggested plan approval date is Tuesday, May 12th and the raw data will be collected by Wednesday, May 13th night. By Friday, May 15th the final report will be prepared by the Team Lead and the Chief Editor. </p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Applying Protocol Analysis to our project will be most beneficial if done during development. When done outside of development or problem solving, protocol analysis is a psychological research technique to help learn about how people solve problems. When applied within development, it is a tool to help developers to see the problem and their approaches to it from a different angle, and possibly find solutions to difficulties.</p>

		<h2>Appendix A: Raw data collected</h2>
		<p>Top-down Approach:
			<o1>
				<li>“Analyze requirements, breaking them down into more basic components.” We should be able to narrow down in the correct direction. I think by using this technique, we can focus on the specific user’s needs. To explain, we first get the general user’s needs and then we narrow it down. So, we can find the specific details. But if we cannot find the essential user’s needs and narrow it down in the wrong way, we may miss the most important thing.</li>
				<li>“Continue breaking down components until the most basic attributes are identified and collect the data from them.”. It is good because we can find the most important requirement if we use a top-down approach. But it is hard to know when we should stop narrowing down. It says, we stop narrowing down when basic attributes are identified, but it depends on the basic attributes, people may choose different basic attributes when they start and will be getting different results. It is not ideal. </li>
				<li>“Record into a word document and report findings.”. It is good to have documentation because they may have a bunch of documents while they are narrowing down requirements. So, making documentation is good to find and check their process. But if they do not organize it, it would be confusing because I think the order should be from general to more specific. </li>
			</o1>
		</p>
		<p>Questionnaires:
			<o1>
				<li>They should be able to pick the right participants. To explain, they should be able to pick the potential users. They should be interested in the software and be able to answer the questions. It is good because we can get the information easier and faster compared to other ways. But it could be hard to find people who are interested in the software. Only a few people are willing to help and answer.</li>
				<li>Questionnaires should be well prepared. To explain, it should not have a bunch of questions. And easy to understand. Because we will ask the questions to people who are interested in the software, we will get the data inexpensively. And it is easy to distribute because we can see the questions and answers easily. But if it is not well organized and questions are hard to understand, participants may not be able to understand the question and we will not get the correct data. </li>
				<li>It can be subjective. To explain, we ask questions and we will get the different answers depending on the participants. Each person may have different ideas about the same question. I think it can be helpful or harmful because we can get the idea in many ways. But it would be hard to organize data if it is too different. </li>
				<li>There should be a prize for answering. I think people usually do not answer the question when they are asked to answer questions from the email or social networking. So, if there is a prize or anything that can intrigue their interest, participants are willing to answer the question. But people may just answer without enough thinking to just get the prize and may provide poor data.</li>

		</p>
		<p>Domain Analysis:
			<o1>
				<li>Google Maps has many advantages to include in the application. This could easily be incorporated via an API made available by google themselves. With this feature, it would make it exceptionally easy for businesses to plan events in the area, and very easy for attendees to find the activity and get to it. If a feature of it included the ability for the businesses to look at statistical data as far as the demographics of those that attend these events in certain areas is included that will make the lives of the event planners that much easier. The only disadvantage to this (depending on one’s opinion of it) would be if a feature was included that gave location notifications to friends. This could be a security issue for those that want to use the application for purposes unintended by the sponsor. This should be included.</li>
				<li>HangTime let’s users sign in using their FaceBook or other popular social media. This would allow the transfer of friends over to this new application. This makes it more convenient for the users because it is less work that they have to do. We all know that mobile application users are cheap and lazy and want the app to do everything for them. This includes that feature. A disadvantage would be that this feature could be an annoyance for the friends of those that use this app if we include too many cross over notifications. It may be good business or may be bad businesses depending on how one looks at it. All in all we should include this feature.</li>
				<li>Virtlo gives the user of the application the ability to “look around” on their mobile camera and receive a radar on their phone’s display showcasing the various events occurring around them and being sponsored by this application. While this is a cool feature, there are several security risks associated with it. One of which requires the application to gain access to the user’s camera. With that being an increasing issue recently this can be something that raises concerns for the users. Another downside of it would be that this feature would only be “cool” in an area where there are many activities to choose from. Otherwise it would require a lot of data to upload the users location and video, and send back the locations and video of the events occuring. Benefits on the business side of it would be easy links that bring the user to the sign up page for that business’s activity and requests payment for admission and other requirements if they so choose to have those features. This requires more discussion, but as of now it seems like a feature that returns less than the effort it takes to make it.</li>
				<li>SeeU was showcased simply for some of the UI features it includes on its application. Many of the ideas consist of side panels that hide a menu or a navigation bar at the bottom of the GUI. These features are a necessity to make navigation for the users as easy as possible and not be confusing for them since we already established that they want everything done for them.</li>
				<li>24me is a sort of calendar feature to include within the application. There are many advantages to this. One being that we can keep both the businesses’ and users’ schedules right there on the app for planning purposes. If this could be linked up with other calendars such as Google Calendar or Microsoft Teams calendar that would only benefit the users. This is definitely more of a convenience than a necessity but could still be a feature that draws many eyes towards the application.</li>
				<li>Uber Service would mainly be used for those that wish to attend the events but don’t have a way to get there. Perhaps they don’t have many friends going with them either and are too scared to use the in app messaging system to ask for a ride from some other stranger going to the event. While this scenario seems easy for the developers of the sfotware, there  could be many security and liability risks to leaving it up to the event attendees to get to the event. Uber would be a way to mitigate that liability by having another professional business with high standards cab the attendees to their desired events. This would be a good feature to include.</li>
				<li>Zimride could also be included to increase versatility but may not be necessary for the beginning stages of application release. This could either be linked up or just simply include a feature in the application itself that follows the same guidelines as Zimride. Either way this may not be a feature or requirement that needs to be included right at launch of the application.</li>
				<li>Event Ready is an application that handles various event planning necessities. Following their formula could be beneficial to the application developers as it will save time not coming up with the formula all on their own. While it would be important to be careful not to copyright the application, this could still be useful and is almost critical to have working at application launch to ensure businesses have a way to plan and advertise their events right off the get go.</li>
			</o1>
		</p>
		<p>Task Analysis:
			<o1>
				<li>Create Business Profile is a requirement for the application. Special permissions and proofs will need to be incorporated to be sure that not just anyone can post their event on the application. Part of the idea behind making money for this application is having business owners “bid” on their reservation to hold an event. The only way to make sure they can do that is through them having an account including verification that they actually are a business and not scammers. This must be included.</li>
				<li>Having a way to manage the account is important for the business to advertise who they are and what they do. When a business plans an event they are more than likely going to want recognition and publicity for their event and thus need to advertise their name. This is also for the safety and security of the users to know that the event they are attending and probably paying for isn’t scamming them. This must be included.</li>
				<li>Post activities to the application itself as a business. This feature could be included once a business has made a “bid” and been accepted by the application admins to host in event. Being able to update their event’s followers of different activities will help them get more attendees. There is no reason for the users of the application to go to an event if there is no advertising of what the event is about because the application doesn’t include a feature that allows them to advertise the event. This must be included. </li>
				<li>Have a way to advertise the activity on the app is something to expound upon. Perhaps the business has a multi-stage event that allows their attendees to come at different days to take advantage of different activities being run. Not being able to advertise this or give the businesses this option won’t kill the credibility of the application. However, including it could be a good feature that gives the application more renown for its features and success. Doesn’t need to be included but should be discussed further.</li>
			</o1>
		</p>
		<p>Interviewing:
			<o1>
				<li>Questions should be well prepared. To explain, we interview the people and the questions should be well organized to answer. If not, interviewees are hard to answer the questions and interviewers get poor data.</li>
				<li>Appointment is required. Unlike questionnaires, interviews are required to have an appointment. We can use the participants' time for only us and we will be able to get better and honest data compared to questionnaires. But it would be hard to make an appointment and we should think about the participant’s schedule. And it takes longer than questionnaires to perform the task.</li>
				<li>Qualitative research is required. In order to mitigate interviewer bias, it allows the interviewer the opportunity to use their bias to enhance their work by gaining a deeper understanding of the problem they are studying. But it does not provide statistical representation. To be specific, it will only provide research data from perspectives.</li>
