        <h2 class="no-top-margin">Overview of the Technique</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3 class="no-top-margin">Technique: Laddering</h3>
            <p>
                In the laddering technique, the stakeholders are asked a
                sequence of questions that are expected to be answered clearly. The
                questions are organized in a systematic format, which will be required to
                have the collected answers to be organized in a structured way. The
                stakeholders must express their knowledge about the domain for this
                technique to be successful. Finally, by using the “Why set of questions,”
                the purpose of this technique is to clarify the requirement and understand
                the core values of the stakeholders regarding the project.
            </p>
            <h3>Pros Regarding Laddering:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This technique provides personal contact with stakeholders by
                    trying to understand and prioritize their core values.</li>
                <li>This technique collects essential requirements from the
                    stakeholders and organizes it into a clear way for
                    interpretation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons Regarding Laddering:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When many questions are applied, the process can become
                    ineffective by having the stakeholders feeling
                    overleaped with an innumerous amount of, “why questions.”</li>
                <li>Maintaining this technique can become challenging when
                    requirements are added in and removed from the laddering
                    process.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Application to the Project:</h3>
            <p>
                The team has studied the stakeholder’s Local Activity App
                Description and identified features described in its description. The team
                has met together and organized a structured ladder interview to identify the
                core value of the stakeholder and the final desires regarding those
                features. Finally, the team has met with the stakeholder and conducted an
                interview to collect the information.

            <h4>Collected Data</h4>
            <p>
                We plan to use a pre-created template to record the
                information that we obtain in the interview. This template will
                be structured so that each construct is viewed in hierarchical
                order with arrows starting at the lowest level of abstraction
                and pointing to the highest level of abstraction. At each
                construct level, the stakeholder will give a score of 1-5, 1
                being least important and 5 being most important, of how
                important each item is to them. This information will be
                compiled into a formal document after the interview is
                conducted.

        <h2>Technique</h2>
        <p>
            Present requirements/features that we have identified from the
            project description. Check to see if there are misunderstandings
            or missing information.
        </p>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3>List of Base Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Businesses can list available activities</li>
                <li>Users can create their own activities</li>
                <li>Users can plan an activity as friends or as a date</li>
                <li>Users have control of the activities that they create.</li>
                <li>Users can specify the group size of activities they make.</li>
                <li>Users can see activities created by other users.</li>
                <li>Users can request to join existing activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with three features that we want to ladder up from.</li>
                <li>Ask a “why” question to discover the core values of the
                    stakeholder.</li>
                <li>Take the stakeholder’s answer and make a construct to form
                    the basis of the next “why” question.</li>
                <li>Continue this process until we reach the highest level of
                    abstraction</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>External Tools Used</h3>
            <p>The interview will be held over zoom.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Analyzing the Data</h2>
        <p>
            After performing the interview, we will go over the data that we
            collect and create a summary of what we learned. After we create
            this summary, we will email a copy to Jordan so he can review it
            and give any feedback that he wants.
        </p>

        <h2>Correlated Data</h2>
        <p>
            This section consists of the data in the form of charts and
            tables that prove a quick overview of the raw data.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            To provide for the key desires of the stakeholder, the
            application should priorities simplicity above features. The
            application is not expected to be used daily; thus, it should put
            efficiency above overall ability. The stakeholder also places great
            value on the application's public notoriety.

                Overall, this app should be easy to use and have a simple
                functionality. The goal of the app is not to elicit frequent use but
                to be a simple medium to provide people with opportunities to meet
                each other.
