        <h2 class="no-bottom-margin">Overview of the Technique</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Apprenticing as an elicitation technique involves a designer and a customer 
                (someone whose current needs would be met by the software system the designer 
                is working on). The designer watches the customer as they perform their tasks 
                and analyzes how they can design the software to improve the workflow. According 
                to Holtzblatt and Beyer, the master-apprentice relationship works well for learning 
                the structure of a system because “As they work, the structure implicit in the work 
                becomes apparent [because] both master and apprentice are paying attention to it. 
                It is easy for the master to pause and make an observation or for the apprentice 
                to ask a question about an action. Observation interspersed with discussion requires 
                little extra effort on the part of either master or apprentice [1].”  
            </p>
            <p>
                While a normal implementation of apprenticing would involve personally watching 
                the process of potential users do the things the project hopes to better facilitate, 
                restrictions in place due to COVID-19 complicate both the ability of the researchers 
                to personally observe these users and the ability of users to actually accomplish 
                the sort of tasks the project is focused on (namely, planning or seeking out local 
                events or making plans with family and friends). Therefore, the technique outlined 
                and carried out in this report will be a modified version of apprenticeship that 
                does not conflict with current local health and safety guidelines, but attempts 
                to capture as much of the same value that a regular approach to apprenticing 
                would yield. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This report will detail the purpose and goals of apprenticeship as a requirements 
                elicitation technique and the plan for implementing this technique. It will also 
                summarize patterns found in the responses of volunteer participants in the research 
                which will give an idea of what potential users currently do in their activity 
                planning and also what they might expect or want from an Activities app.

        <h2>Apprenticeship: Plan</h2>
        <div>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>The purpose of this apprenticeship exercise is to gain a better understanding 
                of how the users of this application currently plan and attend events [1]. The 
                idea behind this is to learn how the users go about planning events so that 
                the application can be designed in a way that is easy to understand and makes 
                it easier for the users to plan and attend events with friends. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The interviews will be conducted Thursday evening and each 
                        member will ask two people the ten questions </li>
                    <li>We will report on our findings and the data collected during

                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Technique</h4>
            <p>Due to COVID-19 we cannot implement the technique as usual. Because 
                of this we have decided to ask a series of ten questions to determine 
                how the customers currently work with planning events and activities. </p>
            <h4>Questions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How do you find out about local activities? </li>
                <li>Can you show me how you find local activities? </li>
                <li>How do you plan events with friends and family? </li>
                <li>Can you show me how you plan events with friends and family? </li>
                <li>How do you find out about events with friends and family? </li>
                <li>How do you coordinate the details for events with friends and family? </li>
                <li>How often are you attending events that are planned by you or others each week? </li>
                <li>How long on average are the events that you attend? </li>
                <li>When you would like to attend an activity or even how do you find people to go with you? </li>
                <li>How do you meet new people who share your interests to go to events with? </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Plan to ask two people the list of ten questions </li>
                <li>Record their answers in an excel spreadsheet </li>
                <li>Compare each other's data and compare similarities </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Collected Data</h4>
            <p>We are collecting data on how people plan for events and activities. 
                We plan to collect this data using a list of questions in a google 
                excel sheet. We chose to use questions because we cannot shadow people 
                due to COVID-19. </p>
            <h4>Analyzing the Data</h4>
            <p>Compare each other’s data and compare similarities in the data. </p>
            <h4>External Tools Used </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Excel sheets </li>
                <li>Communication tools </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Correlated Data</h2>
            <h4>How do you find out about local activities? </h4>
            <p>Those that were asked this question for almost all participants 
                said that they find out about activities through word of mouth 
                and through social media. </p>
            <h4>Can you show me how you find local activities? </h4>
            <p>Most did not answer this question or answered not applicable because 
                they answered word of mouth to the previous question. Those that 
                answered typically used Social media app or a messaging app 
                to find the local activities.  </p>
            <h4>How do you plan events with friends and family? </h4>
            <p>Everyone asked this question all said that they use text messaging 
                to plan events with friends and family. Other answers include phone calls, 
                face to face planning and group messages. </p>
            <h4>Can you show me how you plan events with friends and family? </h4>
            <p>Not much can be shown for this question. </p>
            <h4>How do you find out about events with friends and family? </h4>
            <p>Most people answered this question saying that they are informed about events with 
                friends and family through group messaging. Other answers to this question included 
                finding out in person, phone call, and on social media. </p>
            <h4>How do you coordinate the details for events with friends and family? </h4>
            <p>The most common way to coordinate the details of the event that we notice from the people 
                we worked with is through text message or group chat on social media. A few people also 
                mentioned calling as well. </p>
            <h4>How often are you attending events that are planned by you or others each week? </h4>
            <p>The specific average of time attending events each week is twice a week. 
                A lot of people mentioned twice and three times too, being three times the second most common.  </p>
            <h4>How long on average are the events that you attend? </h4>
            <p>The data shows that the events usually take two or three hours. </p>
            <h4>When you would like to attend an activity or even how do you find people to go with you? </h4>
            <p>Most of them use social media, specially Facebook, to find friends posting an invitation of 
                messaging their most close friends directly. </p>
            <h4>How do you meet new people who share your interests to go to events with? </h4>
            <p>We had two similarities for this answer. First similarity is that people usually meet 
                friends though the friends that they already have. Second similarity, some people are 
                just not interested in making new friends so they do no really have a pattern for that.  </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This report detailed what apprenticing is, how our team executed apprenticing, the data 
                that we collected, and the information that we found. Apprenticing is meant to gain a 
                better understanding of the environment that we are creating an application for and 
                in this case, we did gain new insights and information pertaining to how events are 
                planned and carried out. With our collected data, we should be able to create an 
                application that makes it faster and easier for users to plan and attend events and 
                meet new people. </p>
            <p>The data collected from this apprenticing technique is meant to help create an application 
                that better suits the needs of the future users. From this technique the team was able to 
                discern that there are many ways to create and plan events, however there are some common 
                factors that are of importance. For example, many of the people that we interviewed used 
                social media platforms like Facebook to find out about events. Another example is that 
                many people would use group chats and would often spend an hour or more at events. These 
                all show some very important tactics and ethics people use to plan out events. With this 
                information we can add further requirements to the project, and create an application 
                that becomes the preferred way of planning events. </p>

                        again, because I work for the school, we have a large 
                        information base that's not available to other 
                        students/the public. So I'll also look online on 
                        the school web site or call the student activities 
                        department. There's also social media pages. I don't 
                        really follow school social pages on facebook or instagram, 
                        but if I know something's happening, like i-night, I'll 
                        go look on social media because I feel like it's faster

                        to look up contact info, I just call people whose numbers I have 
                        memorized for the school. Anyway, then on the homepage, they have 
                        the little rotating calendar with the events there. So I'll usually 
                        just go there and if it's a bigger event, I'll see it there. But if 
                        not, I'll go to the search bar and search for it and then click 
                        whatever link pops up.</td>

                        this activity" then I'll either meet up with them there, or I'll send them

                        text them an hour beforehand. I'm not so good at planning far in advance, but if I 
                        decide with my friends we should go just play soccer, then it's more just spur of
