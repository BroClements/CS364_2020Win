   <h2 class="no-top-margin">Overview of the Technique</h2>
   <div class="indent">
      <h3 class="no-top-margin">Technique: Questionnaires</h3>
      <p>
         Questionnaires are an important research technique used to collect data and insights from potential users.
         Using those insights, determining the best features and capabilities for the application will be simple.
      </p>
      <p>
         A questionnaire consists of a set of well-designed and thought out questions. These questions are intended to
         gain information about the respondent, their interests in a project, and their preferences concerning that
         project.
      </p>

      <h3>Pros Regarding Questionnaires:</h3>
      <p>
         Questionnaires provide "an objective means of collecting information about people's knowledge, beliefs,
         attitudes and behavior". [1] The lack of need for face-to-face interaction causes questionnaires to be cheap
         and easily distributed. Questionnaires give fast results due to the internet and other online tools. Modern
         tools make analyzing resulting data simple as well.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Inexpensive</li>
         <li>Easy to Distribute</li>
         <li>Fast Results</li>
         <li>Easy Analysis</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cons Regarding Questionnaires:</h3>
      <p>
         Disadvantages include possibilities for dishonest answers, careless answers, and biased questions. Respondent’s
         answers may be swayed from bias, privacy, and other personal reasons. There can also be interpretation issues
         when the respondent doesn't understand the question fully. Respondents can also ignore or skip questions, if
         the questions are not required. Survey fatigue to kick in is another issue, causing respondents to not complete
         a questionnaire they already started.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Dishonest answers</li>
         <li>Interpretation Issues</li>
         <li>Skipped questions</li>
         <li>Survey Fatigue</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Application to the Project:</h3>
      <p>
         We applied the questionnaire technique to our project by first creating a detailed and thorough plan of action.
         The questionnaire was designed to provide a clear understanding of how a typical user will feel about this
         application and what they will expect from the application.
      </p>
      <p>
         This understanding will help with determining system requirements for the project. Before we were able to
         provide the questionnaire to the user, we had to establish a useful sample for the application, then we needed
         to create effective questions that would clarify and explain what would be needed in the application. From
         these questions we gathered applicable information and data which can be used to determine requirements for the
         application.

   <h2>Technique Plan</h2>
   <div class="indent">
      <h3 class="no-top-margin">Elicitation Technique: Questionnaires</h3>
      <p>This questionnaire will provide a clear understanding of how a typical user will feel about this application
         and what they will expect from the application. There are many benefits to using a questionnaire. They are
         flexible, easy to distribute, and they effectively extract useful insights. [2] </p>
      <h4>Contributors</h4>
      <div class="indent">
         <ul>
            <li>Martin Vaughn – Team Lead</li>
            <li>Anita Achee – Chief Editor</li>
            <li>Kaylee Hartzog – Quality Assurance</li>
            <li>Joshua Rolph – Functional Manager</li>
            <li>Sengthay Kaing – Scrum Master</li>
            <li>Andrew Schimelpfening – Database Manager</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Stakeholders and Customers</h4>
      <p> The stakeholder is Jordan Hamblin. We suspect the most interested customers will be young adults who are
         sociable and who frequently use a mobile device. This questionnaire is intended to either confirm or deny this
         assumption by gathering data on both respondent demographics and respondent interest.   </p>

      <h4>Timeframe</h4>
      <p>
         The total time to plan, conduct, and report on this elicitation technique will be less than one week. The
         planning document will be completed by Thursday, April 30th. The conducting phase will begin the night of April
         30th, and will be completed by the following afternoon, May 1st. The report will be drafted Friday afternoon,
         and will be completed by Saturday evening, May 2nd. 
      </p>
      <h4>Collected Data</h4>
      <p>
         The data collected from this questionnaire will correlate three main attributes about each respondent. This
         includes respondent demographics, respondent interests, and respondent preferences. Correlating respondent
         demographics with respondent interests and preferences will allow for a clear understanding of which types of
         users are most interested, and what those most interested users will require within the application. [3] 
      </p>

      <h3>Technique</h3>
      <div class="indent">
         <h4>Developing a Sample</h4>
         <p>
            Due to current world circumstances, the sample size for our questionnaire will be smaller than
            desired. However, there are “formulas for calculating minimum sample size” [1]. Based on statistical
            theory, a
            sample size of roughly 30 will be sufficient for consistent data. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The questionnaire will be delivered through social media, text messages, and emails. In order to get
            unbiased
            data, the sample needs to be random [4]. To ensure randomization, each of the six techniques contributors
            will
            find a list of 30-50 potential respondents (from one of the previously listed categories), shuffle the list,
            then blindly pick 5. 
         </p>
         <h4>Organization of Questionnaire</h4>
         <p>
            Studies have shown that respondents are more likely to complete a questionnaire of short to medium length
            (3-5
            pages) than a long questionnaire (7+ pages) [5]. Our questionnaire has been designed to be 3 pages long, to
            accommodate the 3 main categories listed in “Collected Data”.   
         </p>
         <p>
            A 2009 study found that in web questionnaires, respondents are most likely to complete a questionnaire that
            has
            close to 10 items per screen, with items split between multiple headers on each screen [6]. Thus, each
            questionnaire page will contain 10 items per with accompanying headers.  
         </p>
         <h4>Developing the Questions</h4>
         <p>
            Keeping in mind the research under ‘Organization of Questionnaire,” we will develop the questions while
            making
            sure to avoid: 
            <div class="indent">
               <ul>
                  <li>Questions that lead the respondent</li>
                  <li>Vague questions with interpretable meanings</li>
                  <li> Open-ended questions</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
         </p>
         <p>
            Emphasis will be placed on achieving overall questionnaire goals during question development. This means
            writing questions that gauge a respondent's interests such as what they expect the application to include,
            what
            features are most important, etc.  
         </p>
         <div class="indent">
            <h4>Questionnaire Steps</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Create questionnaire through Qualtrics</li>
               <li>Randomize a list of contacts</li>
               <li>Blindly choose 5 contacts.</li>
               <li>Send questionnaire to the 5 contacts (5 per each contributor, 30 total)</li>
               <li>Wait for response or request response</li>
               <li>Collect data into one location via Qualtrics </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>External Tools Used</h4>
            <p>The interview will be held over zoom.</p>
         </div>
         <h3>Analyzing the Data</h3>
         <p>
            After performing the interview, we will go over the data that we
            collect and create a summary of what we learned. After we create
            this summary, we will email a copy to Jordan so he can review it
            and give any feedback that he wants.
         </p>
      </div>






      <h2>Correlated Data</h2>
      <p>
         The questionnaire is divided into three sections. First is respondent demographics, second is respondent
         interest, and third is respondent preferences. Each of these sections contains 10 questions. Important
         questions and their corresponding graph are listed below. The remainder of the data can be found in the
         appendix.
      </p>

      <h4>Q6 - How much are you willing to spend at a social event?</h4>

      <h4>Free Response Questions Graph </h4>
      <p>
         Respondents made suggestions through 6 different free response questions. Many of those suggestions
          fell into one of three categories: Discounts, Social Integration, and User-Friendly Design. Total 
          suggestion count listed below.

      <h4>Social Events Preferred Times Graph</h4>
      <p>
         When asked about what time of day people like to attend social events, about 56% responded in the “Evening” 
         and 32% responded at “Night”.

      <h4>Respondent Demographics </h4>
      <p>
         Having given the questions, the users who answer our questions are from ten states. Most respondents were 
         in Idaho, California, Arizona, or Utah.  
      </p>
         <img src="States_Graph.png" alt="States of respondents graph" title="Graph">

      <h4>Data Insights</h4>
      <p>
         There are several important features about this data which are worth noting. Almost all respondents had an 
         interest in the application being free (Question 24). Most respondents were interested in the application 
         being deals/discounts oriented (Q21, Q31, Q6). Users, aside from just wanting to meet new people, will 
         also expect an overall cost benefit from using the application. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Another trend is that respondents expect the application to be simplistic and user friendly. Multiple 
         requests were made in the free response questions to keep the application simple (Q18), to include friendly 
         features like reminders (Q19), and to make the design fun and modern (Q17).
      </p>
      <p>
         A third trend is that users expect the application to include social features and integrations. Respondents 
         made requests to see which of their friends use the application (Q17), to see who is going to certain events 
         (Q20), and to be able to invite friends to events (Q22).
      </p>
      <p>
         Not a single respondent would prefer going to a social event without a friend/family member (Q9). Most 
         respondents were interested in sharing the application with a friend (Q13). Most users will be interested 
         in having at least a basic profile (Q29). While most respondents requested the app to be socially integrated, 
         most were also either not interested at all or only slightly interested in creating their own events for 
         others to join (Q25).
      </p>





      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
         The data collected from the questionnaire shows that potential users for this app were most concerned with
         three main categories, as mentioned in the “Data Insights” section. First, people expect the app to save them
         money and to be free. Second, respondents want the application to be user-friendly and easy to use. Third, the
         app needs to be integrated with social media.
      </p>
      <h3>Recommended Features</h3>
      <p>
         Considering the three previously mentioned categories, we propose five features for the application. The first
         is a filter/sort feature on the main menu. Users would filter out activities that they are not interested in
         and find the ones they are. Users would sort events by price, location, most popular, etc. This corresponds
         with data that suggests user-friendliness and saving money for the user. Second is a subscription feature that
         would allow users to subscribe to a business or another user on the app. This corresponds with data suggesting
         user-friendliness and social integration. Third, a notification feature that would send out reminders about
         upcoming activities and best deals to make the app more user-friendly and savings oriented. Fourth, social
         media integration will encourage users to join activities if they see which of their friends are going. User
         profiles would be linked with social media profiles (like the app Mutual) to quickly verify who a user is and
         who their friends are. Lastly, a rating feature that would show users which activities are the most enjoyed.
         Higher ratings would increase users' confidence that an activity would be worth their time. This will
         correspond with social media integration, allowing users to see who enjoys activities most (like Yelp). We
         propose that the implementation of these features would make the app more user-friendly, more socially
         integrated, more cost beneficial for the user, and overall increase user interest.
