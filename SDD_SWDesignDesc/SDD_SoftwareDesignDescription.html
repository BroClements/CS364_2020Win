         <h1><span class="id">1</span>Introduction</h1>
         <p>Uvents is a mobile application that brings the community together by allowing</p>
         <div class="indent">
            <ul>
               <li>Consumer Users to create or participate in events, which can be set as a Group Event or a Date event</li>
               <li>Commercial Users to list their promotions as an event, which can be seen by the personal users and added to their events</li>
               <li>Admin Users to manage general event policies, monitor user activity, and maintain the application</li>
            </ul>
            <a name="Purpose"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.1</span>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of Uvents is to aid in the provision of social experiences among young adults who otherwise may not know what to do with their socially available time. Consumer Users will be provided with simple access to Group Events and to create
               their own Group Events.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Consumer Users can join and participate in events offered by local businesses. Uvents will receive revenue by having commercial users paying to have their events listed in the application.</p>
            <p>Uvents provides a convenient way for people to easily arrange local events, supports the local economy, and provides recreation in the local area.</p>

            <a name="Scope"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.2</span>Scope</h2>
            <p>Uvents is an application for people to post Group Events/Dates and for people to find and join those Group Events/Dates. The application will allow Consumer Users to view posted events, join events, chat with those going to the same group
               event, and learn of new events in the area.
            </p>
            <p>The application will allow Commercial Users to post events that they have available, for example, bowling at Fat Cats. Commercial Users will pay depending on how visible they want their Event to be to Consumer Users. Admin Users will regulate
               the application and help to answer questions from Commercial & Consumer Users.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="id">1.3</span>Design Goals</h2>
            <p>The Software Design Descriptions document (SDD) plays a vital role in the development and maintenance of software systems. An SDD document represents the software design that should be used for recording “design information, addressing various
               design concerns, and communicating that information to the design’s stakeholders”.[1.5.2.1] An SDD document is used by “project managers, quality assurance, configuration managers, software designers, programmers, testers, and maintainers”.[1.5.2.1]
               Each design description contained in the SDD contains the design information needed by those previously mentioned stakeholders. The SDD is, in essence, a written description of the design for a software product for overall guidance in
               the software project.
            </p>
            <p>One reason as to why one would want to use the SDD is because it allows the designers to communicate design information to the stakeholders. The SDD is also able to specify the requirements and design languages that are to be used. The requirements
               for documenting design viewpoints are also organized in the SDD. The SDD can also be used to organize design concerns, design elements, design constraints, and other aspects of the overall design. “An SDD is prepared to support the development
               of a software item to solve a problem, where this problem has been expressed in terms of a set of requirements.” [1.5.2.1]

               If Admin User clicks the update button and if there is the username was changed, then the new username will be sent by the Server to the Database for storage. The Database will compare the new username with all other Admin, Consumer, and Commercial User
               usernames for duplication.
            </p>
            <p>
               If the new username matches any other current username, the Database will send an error message back to the Server. If the new username does not match any other current username, the Database will save the new username in the Database in the username
               column and into the row associated with the current Admin User.
            </p>
            <p>
               If the Server receives an error message from the Database after attempting to designate to a new username, then the GUI will present to the Admin User that the username is already in use by another user. If the Server does not receive an error message
               from the Database after attempting to designate a new username, then the GUI will indicate to the Admin User that the updates to the profile were saved.

            <h2>7.2 Workflow</h2>
            <p>The workflow technique is designed to give the person who uses it a layed out example of a User performing a task on the system. This takes things like logging in and breaks it down into its steps and decision logic. Decision logic is used to highlight spots in the code where something along the lines of an if statement will be needed. This represents a crossroads where a condition is met or is not. This graphic overview of these different processes makes all of the aspects of something more complicated like logging in, the logic behind it, and lays it out in an easy-to-understand manner. There are different diagrams based on the User and process in question, for a Consumer User making a new account is more simple than an Admin User making a new account. All of these diagrams together form the workflow that can be used by both engineers and developers alike.</p>

               <p>This view focuses on the flow of information and data as the program operates. There is no particular sequence of events. Of course everything begins when a user either creates an account or logs into their account. This can be done by entering credentials manually, or creating/signing in via another social media profile such as Facebook. Accounts can be one of three levels of privilege: Consumer, Commercial, or Admin. Each type of user can view the accounts of other users, but not change any information. Each user has a way to create or edit events, and as such need access to the events database. As well each user has the ability to edit their profile, and need access to the database to make and save changes to their profile. Upon creation of a Consumer User account, a help feature may guide the new user around to show them how to operate the application. Similarly, upon the creation of a Commercial User account a “Tooltips” feature appears to showcase more ways to operate a commercial user account.</p>

            	<h3> Entity Relationships Diagram</h3>
               <p>An entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database. An entity in this context is an object, a component of data. An entity set is a collection of similar entities. These entities can have attributes that define its properties[1]. For the Uvents project, this diagram is built based on the 3.5 Logical Database Requirements section of the SRS. It consists of 14 tables that will hold both user and application data[2]. This database will be stored remotely and the users will have to have an Internet connection to be able to access this database. All the information downloaded from there will be streamed to let the user get the most updated information. The information, channels, and all connections must be secure to protect both users and stakeholders.</p>

            <h2>Database Design</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>(selection) For designing our database, we will use the following design plan modified from the steps found in [1]:
                  <div class="indent">
                     <ul>
                        <li>Find and organize required information </li>
                        <li>Divide information into tables </li>
                        <li>Turn information items into columns </li>
                        <li>Specify primary keys </li>
                        <li>Set up the table relationships (foreign keys) </li>
                        <li>Apply Normalization Rules </li>
                     </ul>
                  </div>
               </li>
               <li>(implementation) Steps a-e of the design plan were completed in the SRS. The database is already divided into tables, each of which has a primary key, and all foreign relationships have been identified. This leaves us with only applying
                  the Normalization Rules. The normalization rules we will apply are as follows, found at [1, 2]:
                  <ul>
                     <li>First Normal Form
                        <div class="indent">
                           <ul>
                              <li>Every data item (intersection of a column and row) contains only a single value, and not a list of values. </li>
                              <li>Values stored in a column should be of the same domain (e.g. an address column should not sometimes contain a lat-long and at other times contain a written address). </li>
                              <li>All columns in a given table should have unique names (e.g. start time and end time for an Event should not both be called simply “time”) </li>
                              <li>The order in which data is stored doesn’t matter</li>
                           </ul>
                        </div>
                     </li>
                     <li>Second Normal Form
                        <div class="indent">
                           <ul>
                              <li>Database is in the First Normal Form </li>
                              <li>Non-key columns are dependent on the entire primary key., not just part of it. In our database, there are no multi-column primary keys, so this is irrelevant. </li>
                           </ul>
                        </div>
                     </li>
                     <li>Third Normal Form
                        <div class="indent">
                           <ul>
                              <li>One non-key column in a table does not depend on any other non-key column in that table. (E.g. if there were a first name, last name, and full name column in one table, and the full name was derived from the first name
                                 and last name, then this rule would be violated. Changing one value in the table should not necessitate the change of another value as well. </li>
                           </ul>
                        </div>
                     </li>

            <h2>Structural Design Technique</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>(selection) For the Structural Design Pattern we will be using the façade design pattern. This will allow us to create classes in the program that are easier to use many times in in many circumstances without the complexity of knowing
                  all the underlying functions and how they work.. </li>
               <li>(implementation)We will use the façade design technique specifically to implement classes that involve the User class. The application has three unique users: admin, consumer, and commercial, but these users all share some similarities.
                  These similarities included ID’s names, and etc. They also share similar functions, such as logging in and creating events. The façade design pattern will allow us to simplify these shared functions so that a single function call can
                  be made where several might otherwise be necessary so that the client does not need to keep track of a lot of unnecessary or repetitive functions. </li>
               <li>(charts) The first chart shows how the client may use simply a login function providing the username and password as parameters. Then, the server can verify that the given username exists and that the password is correct and return an
                  ID. The application will then direct the user to the home page as a validated user.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="./images/StructuralDesign-Login.png" alt="Design Login" class="pic">
            <p>The second chart shows how the Client may simply use a createEvent function (providing the data to be used in creation, e.g. start time, end time, description, etc.). The server will then validate that the data is appropriate (the correct
               data types and allowed for that sort of user), insert the data into the database, and return the new event ID to the client. The application will then direct the user to the event page for their new Event. </p>

            <h2>Entity Relationship</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>(selection) For the Entity Relationship design, we will be using the Entity Relationship Diagram. This will allow us to specify, visualize, construct and document artifacts of data. </li>
               <li>(implementation)We will use the Entity Relationship Diagram technique to specifically visualize and construct data, including relations of columns to each table and among each table. We will apply the following steps to complete the design:
                  <div class="indent">
                     <ul>
                        <li>Identify all the entities in the system. An entity should appear only once in a particular diagram. Create rectangles for all entities and name them properly.</li>
                        <li>Identify relationships between entities. Connect them using a line and add a diamond in the middle describing the relationship. </li>
                        <li>Add attributes for entities. Give meaningful attribute names so they can be understood easily. </li>
                     </ul>
                  </div>
               </li>
               <li>A few things to notice:
                  <div class="indent">
                     <ul>
                        <li>Provide a precise and appropriate name for each entity, attribute, and relationship in the diagram. Terms that are simple and familiar always beats vague, technical-sounding words. In naming entities, remember to use singular
                           nouns. However, adjectives may be used to distinguish entities belonging to the same class (part-time employee and full-time employee, for example). Meanwhile attribute names must be meaningful, unique, system-independent,
                           and easily understandable. </li>
                        <li>Remove vague, redundant or unnecessary relationships between entities.</li>
                        <li>Never connect a relationship to another relationship. </li>
                        <li>Make effective use of colors. You can use colors to classify similar entities or to highlight key areas in your diagrams. </li>
                     </ul>
                  </div>
