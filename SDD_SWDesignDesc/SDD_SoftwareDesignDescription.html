         <h1><span class="id">1</span>Introduction</h1>
         <p>Uvents is a mobile application that brings the community together by allowing</p>
         <div class="indent">
            <ul>
               <li>Consumer Users to create or participate in events, which can be set as a Group Event or a Date event</li>
               <li>Commercial Users to list their promotions as an event, which can be seen by the personal users and added to their events</li>
               <li>Admin Users to manage general event policies, monitor user activity, and maintain the application</li>
            </ul>
            <a name="Purpose"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.1</span>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of Uvents is to aid in the provision of social experiences among young adults who otherwise may not know what to do with their socially available time. Consumer Users will be provided with simple access to Group Events and to create their own Group Events.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Consumer Users can join and participate in events offered by local businesses. Uvents will receive revenue by having commercial users paying to have their events listed in the application.</p>
            <p>Uvents provides a convenient way for people to easily arrange local events, supports the local economy, and provides recreation in the local area.</p>

            <a name="Scope"></a>
            <h2><span class="id">1.2</span>Scope</h2>
            <p>Uvents is an application for people to post Group Events/Dates and for people to find and join those Group Events/Dates.
               The application will allow Consumer Users to view posted events, join events, chat with those going to the same group event,
               and learn of new events in the area.
            </p>
            <p>The application will allow Commercial Users to post events that they have available, for example, bowling at Fat Cats. Commercial Users will pay depending on how visible they want their Event to be to Consumer Users. Admin Users will regulate the
               application and help to answer questions from Commercial & Consumer Users.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="id">1.3</span>Design Goals</h2>
            <p>The Software Design Descriptions document (SDD) plays a vital role in the development and maintenance of software systems. An SDD document represents the software design that should be used for recording “design information, addressing various
               design concerns, and communicating that information to the design’s stakeholders”.[1.5.2.1] An SDD document is used by “project managers, quality assurance, configuration managers, software designers, programmers, testers, and maintainers”.[1.5.2.1]
               Each design description contained in the SDD contains the design information needed by those previously mentioned stakeholders. The SDD is, in essence, a written description of the design for a software product for overall guidance in
               the software project.
            </p>
            <p>One reason as to why one would want to use the SDD is because it allows the designers to communicate design information to the stakeholders. The SDD is also able to specify the requirements and design languages that are to be used. The requirements
               for documenting design viewpoints are also organized in the SDD. The SDD can also be used to organize design concerns, design elements, design constraints, and other aspects of the overall design. “An SDD is prepared to support the development
               of a software item to solve a problem, where this problem has been expressed in terms of a set of requirements.” [1.5.2.1]

                  When the user clicks on the Shareable link bar, the program’s controller should be alerted that the user input an action and a change is happening.
                  Based on the action received, the controller can tell the view how the images on the application should change, and in this case the view should know
                  to make the shareable link bar appear with its accompanying icons and buttons.

                  whether or not the user is already logged in to the social media platform. If not, The program should prompt the user to login with their credentials
                  which will go to the appropriate database to be verified. If not successful, it will ask the user to attempt to login again. If successful, the success
                  status should return to the application letting it know that the link can be shared through the appropriate social media platform. The application will
                  send the link to the appropriate social media platform and the platform will have the link ready in a post.
